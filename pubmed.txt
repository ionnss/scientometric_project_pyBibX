AB  - OBJECTIVE: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, a predementia syndrome 
      characterized by slow gait and subjective cognitive concerns, is associated with 
      multiple age-related risk factors. We hypothesized that MCR is associated with 
      biological age acceleration. We examined the associations of biological age 
      acceleration with MCR, and mortality risk in MCR cases. METHODS: Biological age 
      was determined using proteomic and epigenetic clocks in participants aged 
      65 years and older in the LonGenity study (N = 700, females = 57.9%) and Health 
      and Retirement Study (HRS; N = 1,043, females = 57.1%) cohorts. Age acceleration 
      (AgeAccel) was operationally defined as the residual from regressing predicted 
      biological age (from both clocks separately) on chronological age. Association of 
      AgeAccel with incident MCR in the overall sample as well as with mortality risk 
      in MCR cases was examined using Cox models and reported as hazard ratios (HRs). 
      RESULTS: AgeAccel scores derived from a proteomic clock were associated with 
      prevalent MCR (odds ratio adjusted for age, gender, education years, and chronic 
      illnesses [aOR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.71) as well as 
      predicted incident MCR (HR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.00-1.41) in the LonGenity cohort. 
      In HRS, the association of AgeAccel using an epigenetic clock with prevalent MCR 
      was confirmed (aOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.16-1.85). Participants with MCR and 
      accelerated aging (positive AgeAccel score) were at the highest risk for 
      mortality in both LonGenity (HR = 3.38, 95% CI = 2.01-5.69) and HRS (HR = 2.47, 
      95% CI = 1.20-5.10). INTERPRETATION: Accelerated aging predicts risk for MCR, and 
      is associated with higher mortality in MCR patients. ANN NEUROL

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome in Polypharmacy.
PG  - 1072-1077
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16380 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Risk factors for motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a predementia 
      syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaints, have been 
      identified, but few are reversible. Polypharmacy is a potentially reversible risk 
      factor for cognitive decline, but the relationship between MCR and polypharmacy 
      has not been examined. Our aim was to compare the epidemiology of MCR and 
      polypharmacy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community-based Health and 
      Retirement Study cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1119 adults 65 years and older 
      (mean age = 74.7 ± 7.0 y; 59% female). MEASUREMENTS: Polypharmacy is defined as 
      the use of five or more regularly scheduled medications. MCR is defined as 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait in an individual without dementia. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of MCR among 417 participants with polypharmacy was 10%; it was 6% 
      among 702 participants without polypharmacy. The odds of meeting MCR criteria in 
      those with polypharmacy was 1.8 (confidence interval = 1.0-3.0; P = .035) 
      compared with those without polypharmacy, even after adjusting for high-risk 
      medication use. CONCLUSION: Our results show the coexistence of MCR and 
      polypharmacy in older adults, suggesting a potentially modifiable risk factor for 
      dementia. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1072-1077, 2020.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a novel predementia syndrome; 
      however, whether it can estimate dementia in a nationwide population or has 
      additive estimation validity over cognitive or motoric components alone remains 
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether modified MCR, which incorporates the 
      timed-up-and-go and one-leg-standing tests, improves estimation validity for 
      incident dementia over using cognitive or motoric components alone. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study evaluated data from 
      individuals aged 66 years who participated in the National Screening Program for 
      Transitional Ages in Korea from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013, and 
      examined the association between MCR and incident dementia using Cox proportional 
      hazards regression analysis. Data were collected from the index date (the date on 
      which the participant had the screening) until dementia onset, death, or the end 
      of the follow-up period, whichever came first. The 2 subtypes were defined as 
      subjective cognitive declines with timed-up-and-go impairment or one-leg-standing 
      impairment. The data set was generated with permission from the Korean National 
      Health Insurance Service, and data analysis was conducted from August 2, 2021, to 
      January 31, 2022. Individuals diagnosed with dementia or psychotic disorders or 
      those who had a documented history of dementia medication use before the index 
      date were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was incidence of 
      dementia, defined as an individual receiving their first dementia medication with 
      the relevant International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
      Health Problems, Tenth Revision, codes after the index date. RESULTS: Among the 
      1 137 530 participants (53.7% women), 15 380 (1.4%) met the MCR criteria for the 
      timed-up-and-go subtype, and 32 910 (2.9%) met the criteria for the 
      one-leg-standing subtype. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 7.02 (1.38) years. 
      Participants with MCR demonstrated an approximately 2-fold higher risk of 
      incident dementia than those without MCR (timed-up-and-go subtype, adjusted 
      hazard ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.94-2.13; one-leg-standing subtype, adjusted hazard 
      ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.98-2.12). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study 
      of participants aged 66 years of the National Screening Program for Transitional 
      Ages, modified motoric cognitive risk had higher adjusted hazard ratios of 
      incident dementia than individual cognitive or motoric components. Motoric 
      cognitive risk may be a practical screening tool for estimating dementia among 
      individuals in their mid-60s ; however, further investigation of the clinical and 
      neurobiological aspects is necessary.

AB  - The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a pre-dementia condition, marked by 
      the enhanced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia, together 
      with falls, disability, and abnormal movements. The research studies revealed the 
      distinct neurological and non-neurological clinical gait irregularities during 
      dementia and accelerated functional decline, such as postural and balance 
      impairments, memory loss, cognitive failure, and metabolic dysfunctions. The 
      disabling characteristics of MCR comprise altered afferent sensory and efferent 
      motor responses, together with disrupted visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive 
      components. The pathological basis of MCR relates with the frontal lacunar 
      infarcts, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), gray matter atrophy in the pre-motor 
      and pre-frontal cortex, abnormal cholinergic functioning, inflammatory responses, 
      and genetic factors. Further, cerebrovascular lesions and cardiovascular 
      disorders exacerbate the disease pathology. The diagnosis of MCR is carried out 
      through neuropsychological tests, biomarker assays, imaging studies, 
      questionnaire-based evaluation, and motor function tests, including walking 
      speed, dual-task gait tests, and ambulation ability. Recovery from MCR may 
      include cognitive, physical, and social activities, exercise, diet, nutritional 
      supplements, symptomatic drug treatment, and lifestyle habits that restrict the 
      disease progression. Psychotherapeutic counseling, anti-depressants, and vitamins 
      may support motor and cognitive improvement, primarily through the restorative 
      pathways. However, an in-depth understanding of the association of immobility, 
      dementia, and cognitive stress with MCR requires additional clinical and 
      pre-clinical studies. They may have a significant contribution in reducing MCR 
      syndrome and the risk for dementia. Overall, the current review informs the vital 
      connection between gait performance and cognition in MCR and highlights the 
      usefulness of future research in the discernment and treatment of dementiating 
      illness.

AB  - Conscientiousness is related to a lower risk of motoric cognitive risk syndrome 
      (MCR), a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by slow gait speed and cognitive 
      complaints. The present study examines which facets of conscientiousness are 
      related to concurrent and incident MCR. Participants were dementia-free older 
      adults aged 65-99 years (N = 6001) from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). 
      Baseline data on conscientiousness facets and MCR (cognitive complaints and gait 
      speed) were collected in 2008/2010, along with the covariates: demographic 
      factors, cognition, physical activity, disease burden, depressive symptoms, and 
      body mass index (BMI). MCR was assessed again in 2012/2014 and 2016/2018. 
      Controlling for demographic factors, higher industriousness was related to a 
      nearly 30% lower likelihood of concurrent MCR (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95%CI: 
      0.67-0.85, p < .001) and to about 60% reduced risk of incident MCR (Hazard ratio 
      [HR] = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.56-0.71, p < .001). Self-control, order, and responsibility 
      were also associated with a lower likelihood of concurrent (OR range: 0.82-0.88) 
      and incident (HR range: 0.72-0.82) MCR. Traditionalism (HR = 0.84, 95%CI: 
      0.75-0.93, p < .01) and virtue (HR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.75-0.93, p < .01) were 
      related to a lower risk of incident MCR. Cognition, physical activity, disease 
      burden, depressive symptoms, and BMI partially accounted for these associations. 
      Industriousness is the facet of conscientiousness with the strongest association 
      with risk of MCR. This facet could be targeted in interventions to reduce MCR 
      and, ultimately, dementia.

AB  - Changes in gait, especially decreased gait velocity, may be a harbinger of 
      cognitive decline in aging. Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia 
      syndrome combining slow gait and cognitive complaints, is a powerful clinical 
      tool used to identify older adults at a high risk of developing dementia. The 
      mean prevalence of MCR worldwide, including in a Korean cohort, was around 10%. 
      The reported risk factors for incident MCR include older age, low education, 
      cardiovascular disease, obesity, physical inactivity, and depression. In addition 
      to dementia, MCR is also a risk factor for other age-related adverse conditions 
      such as falls, disability, frailty, and mortality. The use of MCR has advantages 
      over other pre-dementia syndromes in being much simpler to implement and requires 
      fewer resources. Identification of mechanisms responsible for MCR may help in 
      developing interventions to reduce the growing burden of dementia and disability 
      worldwide.

TI  - Gait Dysfunction in Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome.
PG  - S95-S103
LID - 10.3233/JAD-181227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a cognitive-motor syndrome 
      associated with increased risk of transition to dementia. The clinical phenotype 
      of MCR is not yet established. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess clinical gait 
      abnormalities in older adults with MCR. METHODS: Of the 522 community-dwelling 
      non-demented adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the Central Control of Mobility 
      in Aging study, 43 were diagnosed with MCR (47% women) based on presence of 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait velocity (MCRv). Four additional subtypes of 
      MCR were defined by substituting slow gait with short stride length (MCRsl, 
      n = 41), slow swing time (MCRsw, n = 21), high stride length variability (MCRslv, 
      n = 24), and high swing time variability (MCRswv, n = 25). The prevalence of 
      clinical gait abnormalities (neurological or non-neurological) in MCR overall 
      (n = 81) and subtypes was studied. We also examined if gait abnormalities 
      predicted further cognitive and functional decline in MCR cases. RESULTS: Most 
      clinical gait abnormalities were mild (walked without assistance) in the five MCR 
      subtypes (44 to 61%). Neurological (range 24 to 46%) and non-neurological gait 
      abnormalities (33 to 61%) were common in all MCR subtypes. Neurological gaits 
      were most frequent in MCRsl (46%) and non-neurological gaits in MCRv (61%). Over 
      a median 3.02 years of follow-up, presence of gait abnormality in MCR cases at 
      baseline predicted worsening disability scores (estimate 0.17, p-value = 0.033) 
      but not decline on cognitive scores (p-value = 0.056). CONCLUSION: Clinical gait 
      abnormalities are common in MCR syndrome and its subtypes, and are associated 
      with accelerated functional decline.

TI  - Prevalence of motoric cognitive risk syndrome among older adults: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1443-1455
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2022.2158305 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a newly proposed pre-dementia 
      syndrome. Several studies on the prevalence of MCR have been published; however, 
      the data vary across studies with different epidemiological characteristics. 
      Thus, this study aimed to quantitatively analyse the overall prevalence and 
      associated epidemiological characteristics of MCR among older adults aged ≥ 
      60 years. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, 
      Scopus, PsycInfo, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu Database, China 
      Biology Medicine disc and Wanfang Database were searched from their inception to 
      January 2022. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale evaluated the risk of bias. 
      Statistical heterogeneity among the included studies was analysed using Cochran's 
      Q and I(2) tests. A random effect model calculated pooled prevalence owing to 
      study heterogeneity. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess the publication 
      bias. Additionally, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed based on 
      different epidemiological characteristics to determine heterogeneity sources. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-two studies comprising 187,558 samples were obtained. The pooled 
      MCR prevalence was 9.0% (95% confidence interval: 8.3-9.8). A higher MCR 
      prevalence was observed in females, older adults with a low educational level, 
      depression and cardiovascular risk factors, South American populations, and 
      studies with small sample sizes and cross-section designs. Furthermore, 
      subjective cognitive complaint using scale score and gait speed using instrument 
      gait showed higher MCR prevalence. CONCLUSION: MCR is common in older adults, and 
      various epidemiological characteristics influence its prevalence. Thus, 
      preventive measures are required for older adults with higher MCR prevalence.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome Subtypes and Cognitive Profiles.
PG  - 378-84
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glv092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, characterized by slow gait 
      and cognitive complaints, is a simple and easily accessible clinical approach to 
      identify older adults at high risk for transitioning to dementia. This study aims 
      to define subtypes of MCR based on individual quantitative gait variables and to 
      compare their neuropsychological profiles and risk factors as well risk for 
      incident cognitive impairment. METHODS: MCR was diagnosed in 314 
      community-residing, nondemented, older adults aged 65 and older (56% women) based 
      on the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait velocity (MCRv). Four new 
      subtypes of MCR were defined by substituting slow gait with short stride length 
      (MCRsl), slow swing time (MCRsw), high stride length variability (MCRslv), and 
      high swing time variability (MCRswv). MCR subtypes were not mutually exclusive. 
      RESULTS: A total of 25 participants (8%) met criteria for MCRv, 20 for MCRsl 
      (6.4%), 15 for MCRsw (4.8%), 16 for MCRslv (5.1%), 12 for MCRswv (3.8%), and 266 
      participants (84.7%) did not meet criteria for any MCR subtype. At baseline, MCRv 
      was associated with deficits in attention and language as well as in overall 
      cognitive status. MCRswv was associated with deficits in all cognitive domains 
      including memory. Obesity and sedentariness were risk factors of MCRv, MCRsl, and 
      MCRsw. MCRv status predicted incident cognitive impairment in global cognition 
      (odds ratio: 3.59, p = .016), whereas MCRswv status predicted incident cognitive 
      impairment in memory (odds ratio: 4.24, p = .048). CONCLUSIONS: MCR subtypes 
      based on individual gait parameters show commonalities and differences in 
      cognitive profiles and risk factors. Future studies should investigate whether 
      the MCR subtypes predict different subtypes of dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome is a high-risk state for 
      adverse health outcomes in older adults characterised by measured slow gait speed 
      and self-reported cognitive complaints. The recent addition to the Lothian Birth 
      Cohort 1936 of robust dementia outcomes enabled us to assess the prognostic value 
      of MCR for dementia and explore the various trajectories of participants 
      diagnosed with MCR. METHODS: We classified 680 community-dwelling participants 
      free from dementia into non-MCR or MCR groups at mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years. 
      We used Cox and competing risk regression methods, adjusted for potential 
      confounders, to evaluate the risk of developing all-cause incident dementia over 
      10 years of follow-up. Secondarily, we followed the trajectories for individuals 
      with and without MCR at baseline and categorised them into subgroups based on 
      whether MCR was still present at the next research wave, three years later. 
      RESULTS: The presence of MCR increased the risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR 
      2.34, 95%CI 1.14-4.78, p = 0.020), as did fewer years of education and higher 
      depression symptoms. However, MCR has a heterogenous progression trajectory. The 
      MCR progression subgroups each have different prognostic values for incident 
      dementia. CONCLUSION: MCR showed similar prognostic ability for dementia in a 
      Scottish cohort as for other populations. MCR could identify a target group for 
      early interventions of modifiable risk factors to prevent incident dementia. This 
      study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of MCR progression. Exploring the 
      underlying reasons will be important work in future work.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome and Traffic Incidents in Older Drivers in Japan.
PG  - e2330475
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.30475 [doi]
LID - e2330475
AB  - IMPORTANCE: To prevent motor vehicle collisions by older drivers, the increased 
      risk of collisions should be considered early. Cognitive decline increases the 
      risk of car collisions. Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), characterized by 
      the presence of cognitive concerns and slow gait, can be assessed conveniently 
      and is useful to assess the risk of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      association between MCR assessment findings and car collisions among older 
      drivers in Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study 
      used data from a community-based cohort study, the National Center for Geriatrics 
      and Gerontology-Study of Geriatric Syndromes, conducted in Japan from 2015 to 
      2018. Participants were community-dwelling older adults aged at least 65 years. 
      Data were analyzed from February to March 2023. EXPOSURE: MCR was defined as 
      having subjective memory concerns (SMC) and slow gait. Participants were 
      classified into 4 groups: no SMC or slow gait, only SMC, only slow gait, and MCR. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were asked about the experience of car 
      collisions during the last 2 years and near-miss traffic incidents during the 
      previous year through face-to-face interviews. Odds of experiencing a collision 
      or near-miss traffic incident were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: 
      Among a total of 12 475 participants, the mean (SD) age was 72.6 (5.2) years, and 
      7093 (56.9%) were male. The group with only SMC and the group with MCR showed a 
      higher proportion of both car collisions and near-miss traffic incidents than the 
      other groups (adjusted standardized residuals > 1.96; P < .001). Logistic 
      regression analysis showed the only SMC and MCR groups had increased odds of car 
      collisions (only SMC group: odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.72; MCR group: 
      OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.39-2.16) and near-miss traffic incidents (only SMC group: OR, 
      2.07; 95% CI, 1.91-2.25; MCR group: OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.85-2.45) after adjusting 
      for confounding factors. After stratifying MCR assessments by objective cognitive 
      impairment, significant associations were still observed. In the only slow gait 
      group, objective cognitive impairment was associated with increased odds of car 
      collisions (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17-3.28). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older drivers in Japan, SMC and MCR 
      were associated with car collisions and near-miss traffic incidents independent 
      from objective cognitive impairment. Future studies should examine the mechanism 
      of these associations in more detail.

TI  - Personality and Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome.

LID - 10.1111/jgs.16282 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether five major personality traits are related to the 
      motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait speed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: 
      Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Survey 
      (NHATS). PARTICIPANTS: Dementia-free older adults aged 65 to 107 years 
      (N > 8000). MEASUREMENTS: In both samples, participants provided data on 
      personality, cognitive complaints, and measures of gait speed, as well as on 
      demographic factors, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and body mass index 
      (BMI). RESULTS: Across the two samples and a meta-analysis, higher neuroticism 
      was related to higher risk of MCR (combined odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-1.45; P < .001), whereas higher extraversion 
      (combined OR = .71; 95% CI = .65-.79; P < .001) and conscientiousness (combined 
      OR = .70; 95% CI = .62-.78; P < .001) were associated with a lower likelihood of 
      MCR. Higher openness was also related to a lower risk of MCR in the HRS and the 
      meta-analysis (combined OR = .77; 95% CI = .70-.85; P < .001), whereas 
      agreeableness was protective only in the HRS (OR = .83; 95% CI = .74-.92; 
      P < .001). Additional analyses indicated that physical activity, depressive 
      symptoms, and BMI partially accounted for these associations. CONCLUSION: This 
      study adds to existing research on the factors related to the risk of MCR by 
      showing an association with personality traits. Personality assessment may help 
      to identify individuals who may be targeted by interventions focused on reducing 
      the risk of MCR and ultimately of dementia. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:803-808, 2020.

AB  - Dementia is characterized by a long preclinical phase that may last years to 
      decades before the onset of mild cognitive impairment. Slow gait speed and 
      subjective memory complaint commonly co-occur during this preclinical phase, and 
      each is a strong independent predictor of cognitive decline and dementia. Motoric 
      cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a pre-dementia syndrome that combines these two 
      early harbingers of dementia. The risk of cognitive decline or dementia is 
      stronger for MCR than for either slow gait speed or subjective memory complaint 
      alone. Slow gait speed and subjective memory complaint have several common risk 
      factors: cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, abnormal cortisol profiles, 
      low vitamin D levels, brain atrophy with decreased hippocampal volume, and 
      increased deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. The underlying pathogenesis of 
      MCR remains poorly understood. Metabolomics and proteomics have great potential 
      to provide new insights into biological pathways involved in MCR during the long 
      preclinical phase preceding dementia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia syndrome 
      that is characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait. Cardiometabolic 
      multimorbidity (CMM) is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, 
      the relationship between CMM and MCR is still unclear. METHODS: We included 4744 
      participants (aged 65+ years) without MCR at baseline from the National Health 
      and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), who were followed-up from 2011 to 2018. CMM was 
      defined as the presence of two or more cardiometabolic diseases (including 
      diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and stroke). RESULTS: CMM was significantly 
      associated with an increased risk of MCR (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.13-1.75) in fully adjusted models. Consistent results were 
      observed from stratified analyses of different subgroups. Increasing numbers of 
      cardiometabolic diseases were dose-dependently associated with increased MCR risk 
      (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.48). DISCUSSION: CMM is associated with an increased risk 
      of MCR in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a 
      predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait speed and cognitive 
      complaints.Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was associated with an increased MCR 
      risk.An increased number of cardiometabolic diseases were dose-dependently 
      associated with increased MCR risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To report clinical predictors of transition to dementia in motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a predementia syndrome characterized by cognitive 
      complaints and slow gait. METHODS: We examined if cognitive or motoric 
      impairments predicted transition to dementia in 610 older adults with MCR from 
      three cohorts. Association of cognitive (logical memory, clinical dementia 
      rating, cognitive complaint severity, and Mini-Mental State Examination) and 
      motoric factors (gait velocity) with dementia risk was computed using Cox models. 
      RESULTS: There were 156 incident dementias (134 Alzheimer's disease). In the 
      pooled sample, logical memory (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.91), cognitive 
      complaint severity (aHR 1.53), and Mini-Mental State Examination (aHR 0.75) 
      predicted transition of MCR to dementia. Clinical dementia rating score ≥0.5 
      predicted dementia (aHR 3.18) in one cohort. Gait velocity did not predict 
      dementia. DISCUSSION: While MCR is a motoric-based predementia syndrome, severity 
      of cognitive but not motoric impairments predicts conversion to dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently proposed 
      predementia syndrome characterized by subjective cognitive impairment and slow 
      gait. We aim to assess the cardiovascular and noncardiovascular factors 
      associated with MCR. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Studies comparing patients with MCR to those without MCR, and 
      identifying the factors associated with MCR. METHODS: We used databases, 
      including PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase, to identify studies evaluating 
      the factors associated with MCR. Mean differences, odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios 
      (RRs), and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using Review Manager. 
      RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed that all cardiovascular factors, including 
      diabetes (21 studies; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37, 1.64), hypertension (21 studies; OR 
      1.20, 95% CI 1.08, 1.33), stroke (16 studies; OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.70, 2.42), heart 
      disease (7 studies; OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13, 1.86), coronary artery disease (5 
      studies; OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16, 1.91), smoking (13 studies; OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04, 
      1.58), and obesity (12 studies; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13, 1.59) were significantly 
      higher in the MCR than the non-MCR group. Noncardiovascular factors, including 
      age (22 studies; MD = 1.08, 95% CI 0.55, 1.61), education (8 studies; OR 2.04, 
      95% CI 1.28, 3.25), depression (17 studies; OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.65, 2.91), prior 
      falls (9 studies; OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.17, 1.80), arthritis (6 studies; OR 1.35, 95% 
      CI 1.07, 1.70), polypharmacy (5 studies; OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.07, 2.54), and 
      sedentary lifestyle (11 studies; OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.59, 2.52), were significantly 
      higher in the MCR than in the non-MCR group. Alcohol consumption (6 studies; OR 
      0.84, 95% CI 0.72, 0.98), however, favored the MCR over the non-MCR group. 
      Additionally, there was no significant association of MCR with gender (22 
      studies; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94, 1.15) and cancer (3 studies; OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.69, 
      8.28). MCR was also significantly associated with an increased likelihood of 
      incident dementia (5 studies; HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.77, 4.56; P < .001), incident 
      cognitive impairment [2 studies; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.44, 
      2.15], incident falls (4 studies; RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17, 1.60), and mortality (2 
      studies; aHR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35, 1.85). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: MCR syndrome 
      was significantly associated with diabetes, hypertension, stroke, obesity, 
      smoking, low education, sedentary lifestyle, and depression. Moreover, MCR 
      significantly increased the risk of incident dementia, cognitive impairment, 
      falls, and mortality.

AB  - Cognitive disorders represent a leading cause of disability in the aging 
      population, of which dementia has the highest global burden. Early signs of 
      dementia such as slow gait and memory complaints are known to present well before 
      the overt manifestation of the disease. Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome 
      characterized by the simultaneous presence of gait disturbances and memory 
      complaints in older subjects has been proposed to study the close interactions 
      between the physical and cognitive domains as well as a possible approach to 
      identify individuals at increased risk of dementia. In addition, studies have 
      shown MCR as a predictor of other negative outcomes in older adults, including 
      disability, falls and death. However, the concept of MCR is still in its early 
      stage and approach to the syndrome is still not well established. This review 
      aims to put together the various aspects of MCR syndrome including its 
      pathophysiology, diagnosis, epidemiology, and relationship with other geriatric 
      conditions.

LID - 141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia has been identified as a risk factor for cognitive 
      impairment, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently defined 
      pre-dementia syndrome. It is not known whether they are related. We aimed to 
      investigate the association and potential pathways between sarcopenia and MCR in 
      the community elderly by establishing a moderated mediation model. METHODS: 846 
      community residents aged ≥ 60 years were recruited from May 2021 to September 
      2021 and had a comprehensive geriatric evaluation. The diagnosis of sarcopenia 
      followed the criteria issued by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019. 
      MCR was defined as subjective cognitive decline and slow gait. Apathy symptoms 
      and physical activity were assessed by the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the 
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Logistic regression and 
      moderated mediation analyses were conducted to explore the association between 
      the four. RESULTS: 60 (7.1%) had MCR among 846 participants. After full 
      adjustment, sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.81, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = 1.69-8.60, P = 0.001), AES score (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14, 
      P < 0.001), and IPAQ level (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.28-0.66, P < 0.001) were 
      associated with MCR. Apathy partially mediated the relationship between 
      sarcopenia and MCR. Physical activity played a moderation role in the indirect 
      pathway of the mediation model. The increase in physical activity can alleviate 
      the indirect effect of sarcopenia on MCR. CONCLUSION: We established a moderated 
      mediation model to uncover the underlying association mechanism of sarcopenia and 
      MCR preliminarily. These findings suggest that attention should be paid to the 
      management of apathy and physical activity in the context of sarcopenia to 
      prevent early dementia actively. Further validation is needed in future 
      longitudinal studies.

TI  - Association of Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome with Sarcopenia and Systemic 
      Inflammation in Pre-Frail Older Adults.

LID - 936
AB  - Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is defined by the presence of slow gait and 
      subjective cognitive decline. It is well recognized as a prodrome for dementia, 
      but the biological mechanism and trajectory for MCR are still lacking. The 
      objective of this study was to explore the association of MCR with body 
      composition, including sarcopenia and systemic inflammation, in pre-frail older 
      adults in a cross-sectional study of 397 pre-frail community-dwelling older 
      adults. Data on demographics, physical function, frailty, cognition (Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), perceived health and depression were collected. 
      Body composition was measured using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Systemic 
      inflammatory biomarkers, such as progranulin, growth differentiation factor-15 
      (GDF-15), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α 
      (TNF-α), were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were 
      used to analyze the association between MCR, body composition, sarcopenia and 
      systemic inflammatory biomarkers. The prevalence of MCR was 14.9%. They were 
      significantly older and there were more females, depression, functional 
      impairment, lower education, physical activity and MoCA scores. Body fat 
      percentage (BF%), fat mass index, fat to fat free mass ratio (FM/FFM) and 
      sarcopenia prevalence were significantly higher in MCR. Serum GDF-15 and TNF-α 
      levels were highest with progranulin/TNF-α and IL-10/TNF-α ratio lowest in MCR. 
      Compared to healthy patients, MCR was significantly associated with sarcopenia 
      (aOR 2.62; 95% CI 1.46-3.17), BF% (aOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.12), FMI (aOR 1.16; 
      95% CI 1.02-1.30) and FM/FFM (aOR 6.38; 95% CI 1.20-33.98). The association of 
      IL-10 to TNF-α ratio (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) and IL-10 (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 
      0.05-0.98) with MCR were independent of sarcopenia and BF%. Longitudinal 
      population studies are needed to understand the role of body fat indices and 
      IL-10 in pre-frail older adults with MCR and trajectory to dementia.

TI  - Frailty and Risk of Incident Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome.
PG  - S85-S93
LID - 10.3233/JAD-190517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is highly prevalent among older adults, and associated with 
      cognitive decline. Relationship between frailty and motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by the presence of 
      subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait, is yet to be elucidated. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine whether frailty increases the risk of developing incident 
      MCR. METHODS: We analyzed 641 adults, aged 65 and above, participating in the 
      LonGenity study. Frailty was defined using a 41-point cumulative deficit frailty 
      index (FI). MCR was diagnosed at baseline and annual follow-up visits using 
      established criteria. Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the 
      association of baseline frailty with incident MCR, and reported as hazard ratio 
      (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, and education. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, 70 participants (10·9%) had prevalent MCR. Of the remaining 
      571 non-MCR participants (mean age 75.0, 57.3% women), 70 developed incident MCR 
      (median follow-up 2.6 years). Higher frailty scores at baseline were associated 
      with an increased risk of incident MCR (HR for each 0.01 increase in the FI: 
      1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.11; p = 0.0002). The result was unchanged even after 
      excluding mobility related or chronic illnesses items from the FI as well as 
      accounting for reverse causation, competing risk of death, baseline cognitive 
      status, social vulnerability, and excluding participants with mild cognitive 
      impairment syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of frailty increase risk for 
      developing MCR and suggest shared mechanisms. This association merits further 
      study to identify strategies to prevent cognitive decline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia syndrome 
      characterized by subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait, is associated 
      with disability in instrumental activities of daily living. It is unknown whether 
      these functional limitations occur even before this pre-dementia syndrome is 
      diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: To assess profiles of complex and instrumental activities 
      of daily living in the prodromal stages of MCR. METHODS: We examined functional 
      profiles in 46 older adults (mean age 79 years, 59% women) living in the 
      community with normal cognition at baseline who developed MCR over follow-up 
      ('pre-MCR') with 264 older adults (mean age 75 years, 57% women) who remained 
      cognitively intact over the follow-up period. RESULTS: Pre-MCR individuals had 
      more limitations on complex everyday function at baseline compared to normal 
      controls in multivariable logistic regression models (odds ratio 1.21). Pre-MCR 
      cases at baseline had limitations in handling finances (odds ratio 3.0) and 
      performing hobbies (odds ratio 5.5) as compared to normal controls. Pre-MCR cases 
      had a greater difference in the number of complex functional limitations from 
      baseline to MCR compared to the difference from baseline to final visit for the 
      controls (1.2±3.0 versus 0.5±2.2, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Limitations in complex 
      everyday tasks arise in the prodromal stages of MCR and can assist in risk 
      prognostication.

TI  - Association of Handgrip Strength Weakness and Asymmetry With Incidence of Motoric 
      Cognitive Risk Syndrome in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.
PG  - e2342-e2349
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207308 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a type of 
      pre-dementia. It is defined as the co-occurrence of subjective cognitive 
      complaints and a slow gait speed. A recent study found that handgrip strength 
      (HGS) asymmetry is associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. We aimed to investigate the associations of HGS weakness and asymmetry 
      separately and together with MCR incidence among older Chinese adults. METHODS: 
      Data from the 2011 and 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal 
      Study were used. HGS values <28 kg for male participants and <18 kg for female 
      participants were considered HGS weaknesses. HGS asymmetry was assessed by the 
      ratio of nondominant to dominant HGS. We used 3 different cutoff values of HGS 
      ratio to define asymmetry, including 10%, 20%, and 30%. Specifically, HGS ratios 
      <0.90 or >1.10 (10%), <0.80 or >1.20 (20%), and <0.70 or >1.30 (30%) were 
      classified as asymmetry. The participants were classified into 4 groups: neither 
      weakness nor asymmetry (neither), asymmetry only, weakness only, and weakness and 
      asymmetry (both). The association between baseline HGS status and 4-year 
      incidence of MCR was examined using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A 
      total of 3,777 participants 60 years and older were included in the baseline 
      analysis. The prevalence of MCR at the baseline was 12.8%. Participants with 
      asymmetry only, weakness only, and both showed significantly increased risk of 
      MCR. After excluding participants with MCR at baseline, 2,328 participants were 
      included in the longitudinal analysis. There were 111 MCR cases (4.77%) over the 
      4-year follow-up period. Participants with HGS weakness and asymmetry together at 
      baseline had increased odds of incident MCR (HGS ratio at 10%: odds ratio [OR] 
      4.48, p < 0.001; HGS ratio at 20%: OR 5.43, p < 0.001; HGS ratio at 30%: OR 6.02, 
      p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These results show that the presence of both HGS 
      asymmetry and weakness is associated with MCR incidence. The early recognition of 
      HGS asymmetry and weakness may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of 
      cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - Epidemiology of Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome in the Kerala Einstein Study: 
      Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e49933
LID - 10.2196/49933 [doi]
LID - e49933
AB  - BACKGROUND: The southern India state of Kerala has among the highest proportion 
      of older adults in its population in the country. An increase in chronic 
      age-related diseases such as dementia is expected in the older Kerala population. 
      Identifying older individuals early in the course of cognitive decline offers the 
      best hope of introducing preventive measures early and planning management. 
      However, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of predementia syndromes at the early 
      stages of cognitive decline in older adults are not well established in India. 
      OBJECTIVE: The Kerala Einstein Study (KES) is a community-based cohort study that 
      was established in 2008 and is based in the Kozhikode district in Kerala state. 
      KES aims to establish risk factors and brain substrates of motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR), a predementia syndrome characterized by the presence of slow gait 
      and subjective cognitive concerns in individuals without dementia or disability. 
      This protocol describes the study design and procedures for this KES project. 
      METHODS: KES is proposing to enroll a sample of 1000 adults ≥60 years old from 
      urban and rural areas in the Kozhikode district of Kerala state: 200 recruited in 
      the previous phase of KES and 800 new participants to be recruited in this 
      project. MCR is the cognitive phenotype of primary interest. The associations 
      between previously established risk factors for dementia as well as novel risk 
      factors (apathy and traumatic brain injury) and MCR will be examined in KES. Risk 
      factor profiles for MCR will be compared between urban and rural residents as 
      well as with individuals who meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI). Cognitive and physical function, medical history and medications, 
      sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle patterns, and activities of daily 
      living will be evaluated. Participants will also undergo magnetic resonance 
      imaging and electrocardiogram investigations. Longitudinal follow-up is planned 
      in a subset of participants as a prelude to future longitudinal studies. RESULTS: 
      KES (2R01AG039330-07) was funded by the US National Institutes of Health in 
      September 2019 and received approval from the Indian Medical Council of Research 
      to start the study in June 2021. We had recruited 433 new participants from urban 
      and rural sites in Kozhikode as of May 2023: 41.1% (178/433) women, 67.7% 
      (293/433) rural residents, and 13.4% (58/433) MCR cases. Enrollment is actively 
      ongoing at all the KES recruitment sites. CONCLUSIONS: KES will provide new 
      insights into risk factors and brain substrates associated with MCR in India and 
      will help guide future development of regionally specific preventive 
      interventions for dementia. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - Reward System Dysfunction and the Motoric-Cognitive Risk Syndrome in Older 
      Persons.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10040808 [doi]
LID - 808
AB  - During aging, many physiological systems spontaneously change independent of the 
      presence of chronic diseases. The reward system is not an exception and its 
      dysfunction generally includes a reduction in dopamine and glutamate activities 
      and the loss of neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These impairments 
      are even more pronounced in older persons who have neurodegenerative diseases 
      and/or are affected by cognitive and motoric frailty. All these changes may 
      result in the occurrence of cognitive and motoric frailty and accelerated 
      progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
      diseases. In particular, the loss of neurons in VTA may determine an acceleration 
      of depressive symptoms and cognitive and motor frailty trajectory, producing an 
      increased risk of disability and mortality. Thus, we hypothesize the existence of 
      a loop between reward system dysfunction, depression, and neurodegenerative 
      diseases in older persons. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the 
      determinant role of the reward system in the onset of motoric-cognitive risk 
      syndrome.

TI  - Social isolation, loneliness, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome among older 
      adults in China: A longitudinal study.
PG  - e5911
LID - 10.1002/gps.5911 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the associations between social 
      isolation, loneliness, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) among older 
      adults in China. METHODS: Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement 
      Longitudinal Study in the 2011 and 2015 waves. Social isolation and loneliness 
      were measured by an index and an item, and MCR was defined as subjective 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait. Multivariable logistic regression analyses 
      were performed to examine the associations between social isolation, loneliness, 
      and MCR by gender. RESULTS: Of 3251 eligible participants, the incidence of MCR 
      was 10.03%. Social isolation and loneliness were not significantly associated 
      with incident MCR in men. Loneliness was positively associated with incident MCR 
      in women (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.01), while social isolation was not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is associated with incident MCR among female older adults 
      in China. More attention is advised to be paid to loneliness among female older 
      adults, to hold promise for the prevention and reduction of MCR.

TI  - Intraindividual difference in estimated GFR by creatinine and cystatin C, 
      cognitive trajectories and motoric cognitive risk syndrome.
LID - gfad234 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfad234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraindividual differences between estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate (eGFR) based on cystatin C (eGFRcys) and creatinine (eGFRcr) can convey 
      important clinical information regarding the health status. However, the clinical 
      implications of these differences (eGFRdiff) for risk of cognitive decline and 
      motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate 
      the longitudinal associations of eGFRdiff with cognitive trajectories and 
      incident MCR. METHODS: Based on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal 
      Study, we identified two study sub-cohorts: one for cognitive trajectory 
      follow-up (6423 participants; years:2011-2018) and another for incident MCR 
      follow-up (2477 participants; years:2011-2015). The eGFRdiff was defined as 
      eGFRcys minus eGFRcr. Adjusted ordinal and binary logistics regression models 
      were separately used to assess the associations of eGFRdiff with cognitive 
      trajectories and incident MCR. We also performed discordance analyses for 
      eGFRdiff vs eGFRcys, eGFRcr or eGFR based on both creatinine and cystatin C 
      (eGFRcys-cr). RESULTS: In the first sub-cohort, four distinct 7-year cognitive 
      trajectories were identified. Each 1-SD higher eGFRdiff (value for eGFRcys minus 
      eGFRcr) was associated with a lower risk of poorer cognitive trajectories (OR: 
      0.909, 95% CI: 0.877-0.942). In the second sub-cohort, 121 participants developed 
      incident MCR after a 4-year follow-up. Each 1-SD higher eGFRdiff (value for 
      eGFRcys minus eGFRcr) was linked with a 25.3% (95%CI: 16.6%-33.2%) decreased risk 
      for MCR. The above associations persisted in individuals with normal kidney 
      function. Additionally, the risk for cognitive decline and incident MCR was more 
      strongly associated with eGFRcys than eGFRcr and eGFRcys-cr. For the discordance 
      analyses, 'discordantly high eGFRdiff/low eGFR' group, but not 'discordantly low 
      eGFRdiff/high eGFR', exhibited a significantly lower risk of poorer cognitive 
      trajectories and MCR compared to the concordant group. CONCLUSIONS: A large 
      negative difference between eGFRcys and eGFRcr (eGFRcys lower than eGFRcr) was 
      associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and incident MCR. The eGFRdiff 
      could capture additional valuable risk information beyond eGFRcys, eGFRcr, and 
      eGFRcys-cr.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence of links between gait and cognition in 
      aging, cognitive risk assessments that incorporate motoric signs have not been 
      examined. We sought to validate a new Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome to 
      identify individuals at high risk of developing dementia. METHODS: We evaluated 
      997 community residing individuals aged 70 and older participating in the 
      Einstein Aging Study over a median follow-up time of 36.9 months. MCR syndrome 
      was defined as presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait (one standard 
      deviation below age- and sex-specific gait speed means) in nondemented 
      individuals. Cox models were used to evaluate the effect of MCR syndrome on the 
      risk of developing dementia and subtypes. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants met 
      criteria for MCR syndrome at baseline with a prevalence of 7% (95% CI: 5-9%). 
      Prevalence of MCR increased with age. Participants with MCR were at higher risk 
      of developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR] adjusted for age, sex, and education: 
      3.27, 95% CI: 1.55-6.90) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR: 12.81, 95% CI: 
      4.98-32.97). The association of MCR with risk of dementia or vascular dementia 
      remained significant even after accounting for other confounders and diagnostic 
      overlap with "cognitive" mild cognitive impairment syndrome subtypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A motor-based MCR syndrome provides a clinical approach to identify 
      individuals at high risk for dementia, especially vascular dementia, to target 
      for further investigations and who may benefit from preventive interventions.

PG  - 718-26

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to report prevalence of motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR), a newly described predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait 
      and cognitive complaints, in multiple countries, and its association with 
      dementia risk. METHODS: Pooled MCR prevalence analysis of individual data from 
      26,802 adults without dementia and disability aged 60 years and older from 22 
      cohorts from 17 countries. We also examined risk of incident cognitive impairment 
      (Mini-Mental State Examination decline ≥4 points) and dementia associated with 
      MCR in 4,812 individuals without dementia with baseline Mini-Mental State 
      Examination scores ≥25 from 4 prospective cohort studies using Cox models 
      adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: At baseline, 2,808 of the 26,802 
      participants met MCR criteria. Pooled MCR prevalence was 9.7% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 8.2%-11.2%). MCR prevalence was higher with older age but there 
      were no sex differences. MCR predicted risk of developing incident cognitive 
      impairment in the pooled sample (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.0, 95% CI 
      1.7-2.4); aHRs were 1.5 to 2.7 in the individual cohorts. MCR also predicted 
      dementia in the pooled sample (aHR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.3). The results persisted 
      even after excluding participants with possible cognitive impairment, accounting 
      for early dementia, and diagnostic overlap with other predementia syndromes. 
      CONCLUSION: MCR is common in older adults, and is a strong and early risk factor 
      for cognitive decline. This clinical approach can be easily applied to identify 
      high-risk seniors in a wide variety of settings.

PG  - 875-887
LID - 10.3233/JAD-180203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, a recently described 
      pre-dementia syndrome, has been associated with cardiovascular disease and their 
      risk factors (CVDRF). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MCR syndrome was associated 
      with CVDRF in French community-dwelling older adults, and to quantitatively 
      evaluate, with a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association of MCR 
      syndrome with CVDRF. METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional design, 238 older adults 
      without dementia were selected from the French GAIT study. An English and French 
      systematic Medline and Embase search (without limiting date of publication) was 
      also conducted in February 2017 using the terms "motoric cognitive risk syndrome" 
      OR "motoric cognitive risk" OR "motoric risk". The systematic review and 
      meta-analysis included 8 studies. CVDRF were defined as cardiovascular diseases, 
      hypertension, diabetes, stroke, obesity and abnormal waist-hip ratio (WHR). 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR syndrome in the current original study was 16.8%. 
      MCR syndrome was associated with abnormalWHR(Odds ratio [OR] >2.8 with p < 0.020) 
      and high blood pressure (OR >2.5 with p < 0.025). Of the 202 originally 
      identified abstracts, 7 (3.5%) were selected for the systematic review. The 
      meta-analysis showed that all pooled OR were significant with a p-value <0.001 
      (OR = 1.41 for cardiovascular diseases, 1.21 for hypertension, 1.44 for diabetes, 
      2.05 for stroke, and 1.34 for obesity). When pooling all CVDRF, the overall OR 
      was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.33-1.45) with p-value <0.001. CONCLUSION: MCR syndrome is 
      significantly associated with CVDRF. These findings suggest that a vascular 
      mechanism may underlie the pathophysiology of MCR syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report incidence and risk factors for motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR), a newly described predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait 
      and cognitive complaints. METHODS: We examined incidence rates of MCR in 3,128 
      adults aged 60 years and older, MCR- and dementia-free at baseline, participating 
      in 4 US-based cohort studies. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) for the association of modifiable risk factors with risk of MCR were 
      computed using Cox models. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, 
      823 of the 3,128 participants met MCR criteria. The overall age- and sex-adjusted 
      incidence of MCR was 65.2/1,000 person-years (95% CI: 53.3-77.1), and ranged from 
      50.8/1,000 person-years to 79.6/1,000 person-years in the individual cohorts. MCR 
      incidence was higher with older age but there were no sex differences. In the 
      pooled sample adjusted for age, sex, education, and cohort source, strokes (HR 
      1.42, 95% CI: 1.14-1.77), Parkinson disease (HR 2.52, 95% CI: 1.68-3.76), 
      depressive symptoms (HR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.28-2.13), sedentariness (HR 1.76, 95% CI: 
      1.44-2.17), and obesity (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.17-1.65) predicted risk of incident 
      MCR. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MCR is high in older adults. Identification of 
      modifiable risk factors for MCR will improve identification of high-risk 
      individuals and help develop interventions to prevent cognitive decline in aging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia symptom 
      strongly predicting cognitive decline and dementia. Although advancements in 
      elucidating the epidemiology of MCR, the evidence about the association between 
      sarcopenia, sarcopenia parameters, and MCR remains scarce. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this study was to determine the associations between sarcopenia, 
      sarcopenia parameters, and MCR among community-dwelling Chinese older adults. 
      METHODS: A total of 4,184 community-dwelling older adults from the China Health 
      and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in the 2011 waves were included. 
      Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 
      criteria. Sarcopenia parameters included handgrip strength (HGS), height-adjusted 
      appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM/Ht(2)), and five-times sit-to-stand test 
      time (FTSSTT). MCR was defined as subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait 
      speed without dementia or impaired mobility. The associations between sarcopenia, 
      sarcopenia parameters, and MCR were conducted using the logistic regression 
      model. The restricted cubic spline with four knots were performed to determine 
      the nonlinear and linear relationships between HGS, ASM/Ht(2), FTSSTT, and MCR. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR in wave 2011 of CHARLS was 11.2%. After adjustment 
      for potential confounders, we found sarcopenia [odd ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.70 
      (1.13 ~ 2.54), p = 0.011], lower HGS [0.97 (0.96 ~ 0.99), p = 0.001], and more 
      FTSSTT [1.12 (1.10 ~ 1.15), p < 0.001] were significantly associated with a 
      higher risk of MCR. There was an inverse linear dose-response between HGS and MCR 
      (p for overall = 0.008, p for nonlinearity =0.776). The nonlinear relationship 
      between FTSSTT and MCR was found (p for overall <0.001, p for 
      nonlinearity = 0.025) with FTSSTT ≥29 s being associated with a higher risk of 
      MCR. A dose-response relationship was not found between ASM/Ht(2) and MCR (p for 
      overall =0.589). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia, lower HGS, and higher FTSSTT are 
      associated with MCR among older adults in China, while the latter two exhibit a 
      dose-response relationship with MCR. It is suggested that timely identification 
      and management of sarcopenia and its parameters may help delay the progression of 
      cognitive impairment and promote healthy aging.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive frailty (CF) is associated with dementia and disability. 
      It was initially proposed in 2013 by the International Institute of Nutrition and 
      Aging and the International Geriatrics Association. Over the years, there have 
      been many emerging definitions e.g., Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR), 
      Physio-cognitive Decline Syndrome (PCDS), reversible CF and potentially 
      reversible CF. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the demographics 
      including physical, functional, and psychosocial factors for the four CF 
      definitions amongst community-dwelling older adults. In addition, the effect of 
      dual-task exercise on the reversibility of different definitions of CF was also 
      studied. METHODS: Participants were community-dwelling older adults aged 
      ≥60 years recruited between August 2017 and December 2019. Older adults screened 
      to be frail, prefrail or have cognitive impairment were invited to participate in 
      dual-task exercise program called HAPPY (Healthy Ageing Promotion Program for 
      You). Improvement in cognition, frailty, and physical performance after a 3-month 
      dual-task exercise intervention program was compared with controls. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of CF depending on definition ranged from 8.8% to 28.7% with minimal 
      overlap. The cognitive scores were significantly lower in all the groups 
      predominantly affecting non-memory domains except for reversible CF. Frailty was 
      three to seven times more prevalent in CF. MCR group had higher prevalence of 
      functional limitation, pain and depression. All four groups had significant 
      increase in global cognition scores especially in the attention domain where the 
      control group declined, and reduction in the prevalence of frailty post 
      intervention. MCR and reversible CF were significantly associated with increased 
      odds of cognitive improvement after 3 months of intervention compared with 
      control. CONCLUSION: CF is a novel concept and regardless of the definitions, is 
      a target for reversing frailty, functional limitation and cognitive impairment 
      through dual-task exercise. Long-term prospective studies are needed to evaluate 
      the effectiveness of dual-task interventions in delaying the conversion to 
      dementia and reduction of disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between olfactory dysfunction, 
      Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a 
      predementia syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait that is 
      associated with risk for AD and other dementias. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study to examine whether baseline 
      olfactory function was associated with the risk of incident MCR in 1,119 adults 
      aged 60 years and older (75.1% female). The association between performance on 
      the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and incident MCR risk was computed 
      using Cox models and reported as the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CIs adjusted for 
      demographic, comorbidity, and cognitive factors. Furthermore, we assessed the 
      relationship between postmortem AD pathology and non-AD pathology and olfactory 
      function at the time of MCR diagnosis using linear regression models adjusted for 
      sex, education, age at death, and time from diagnosis to death. RESULTS: There 
      were 544 (48.6%) incident cases of MCR over a median follow-up of 3.94 years. 
      Lower BSIT scores (poor olfaction) at baseline were associated with an increased 
      risk of incident MCR (HR for a 1-point increase in BSIT score 0.92; 95% CI 
      0.88-0.96) in fully adjusted models. Those with hyposmia (scores of ≤8 on the 
      BSIT) at baseline (26.6%) were at an increased risk of MCR (HR 1.44; 95% CI 
      1.19-1.74) compared with those with normal olfactory function. Higher levels of 
      the composite measure of global AD pathology and presence of Lewy body pathology 
      were associated with lower BSIT scores at the time of incident MCR diagnosis (n = 
      118). τ tangle density, a specific component of AD pathology, was inversely 
      associated with olfactory function, and the correlation remained after 
      controlling for mild cognitive impairment syndrome and the presence of Lewy body 
      pathology. DISCUSSION: The results provide evidence that olfactory dysfunction 
      precedes MCR incidence and is related to Alzheimer pathology, providing a 
      clinical approach to risk stratify and subtype MCR.

      Syndrome.
PG  - igac048
LID - 10.1093/geroni/igac048 [doi]
LID - igac048
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a 
      predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaint. The 
      relationship between MCR and social support-a potentially modifiable risk factor 
      of dementia-is currently unknown. The current study aimed to determine whether 
      MCR incidence varies as a function of social support in aging. RESEARCH DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: We examined MCR incidence in 506 community-dwelling older adults (M 
      Age 76.59; 57.3% female) without MCR or dementia at baseline. We quantified 
      perceived levels of social support with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support 
      Survey, incorporating four different categories of support: (a) 
      emotional/informational support, (b) tangible support, (c) affectionate support, 
      and (d) positive social interactions. We used Cox regression analyses, adjusted 
      for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, comorbidities, and 
      global cognition, to estimate hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 2.5 years (range = 1-7 years), 38 
      participants (9.8%) developed MCR. Increased tangible support decreased the risk 
      of MCR by 30% (aHR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53-0.92, p = .011). Increased overall social 
      support decreased the risk of MCR by 33% (aHR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.46-0.98, 
      p = .038). Other subcategories of social support were not associated with a 
      decreased risk of MCR (p > .05). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher levels of 
      tangible social support, as well as overall social support, were associated with 
      reduced risk for MCR in older adults. Increasing social support may be a 
      promising avenue of intervention for reducing the risk of MCR, dementia, and 
      other forms of cognitive decline.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome, Subtypes and 8-Year All-Cause Mortality in Aging 
      Phenotypes: The Salus in Apulia Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070861 [doi]
LID - 861
AB  - Background: This study aims to establish the key clinical features of different 
      motoric cognitive risk (MCR) subtypes based on individual quantitative measures 
      of cognitive impairment and to compare their predictive power on survival over an 
      8-year observation time. Methods: We analyzed data from a population-based study 
      of 1138 subjects aged 65 years and older in south Italy. These individuals were 
      targeted and allocated to subtypes of the MCR phenotype according to the slowness 
      criterion plus one other different cognitive domain for each characterized 
      phenotype (Subjective Cognitive Complaint [SCC]; Global Function [Mini Mental 
      State Examination (MMSE) < 24]; or a combination of both). Clinical evaluation 
      and laboratory assays, along with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological 
      and physical tests, completed the sample investigation. Results: MCR prevalence 
      was found to be 9.8% (n = 112), 3.6% (n = 41), 3.4% (n = 39) and 1.8% (n = 21) 
      for the MCR, MCR-GlobalFunction, MCR-StructuredSCC and MCR-SCC and 
      GlobalFunction, respectively. Univariate Cox survival analysis showed an 
      association only of the MCR-GlobalFunction subtype with an almost three-fold 
      increased risk of overall death as compared to the other counterparts (HR 2.53, 
      95%CI 1.28 to 4.99) over an 8-year observation period. Using Generalized 
      Estimating Equations (GEE) for clustered survival data, we found that MCR males 
      had an increased and significant mortality risk with respect to MCR female 
      subjects. Conclusions: MCR phenotypes assigned to the MMSE cognitive domain are 
      more likely to have an increased risk of overall mortality, and gender showed a 
      huge effect on the risk of death for MCR subjects over the 8-year observation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Though motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) share risk factors with 
      disability, whether it predict disability remains understudied. OBJECTIVES: This 
      study aims to examine the association between MCR and incident disability. 
      DESIGN: Longitudinal study. METHODS: MCR was defined as subjective cognitive 
      complaints and objective slow gait speed. Two subtypes of MCR were defined by 
      whether memory impairment (MI) was also present, MCR-MI and MCR-non-MI. Incident 
      activities of daily living (ADL) disability and instrumental activities of daily 
      living (IADL) disability were outcome measures. Multiple logistic regression 
      analysis was used to assess the independent effect of MCR at baseline on the odds 
      of ADL/IADL disability at a 7 year follow-up. RESULTS: Among the subjects who 
      were not disabled at baseline and followed for 7 years, 34.66% reported incident 
      ADL disability, and 31.64% reported incident IADL disability. Compared with 
      participants without MCR at baseline, those with MCR had 58% increased odds of 
      incident ADL disability (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.19-2.09) and 46% increased odds of 
      incident IADL disability (OR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.13-1.88) after 7 years. MCR-non-MI 
      was associated with a 56.63% increased risk of ADL disability and a 34.73% 
      increased risk of IADL disability. MCR-MI was associated with an even higher risk 
      of IADL disability (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.18-3.88). CONCLUSIONS: MCR is an 
      independent risk factor for both incident ADL and IADL disability. MCR-MI 
      predicts a higher risk for disability than MCR-non-MI. Early identification of 
      MCR among older adult is recommended and may decrease future risk of disability.

PG  - 944-950
LID - 10.1007/s00115-023-01487-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The predicted increase in adults with dementia will pose a major 
      challenge for the German healthcare system. To mitigate this challenge, the early 
      detection of adults with an increased risk of dementia is crucial. In this 
      context, the concept of motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome has been introduced 
      into the English literature but is currently relatively unknown in 
      German-speaking countries. OBJECTIVE: What are the characteristics and diagnostic 
      criteria of MCR? What is the impact of MCR on health-related parameters? What is 
      the current state of evidence regarding the risk factors and prevention of the 
      MCR? MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the English language literature concerning 
      MCR, the associated risk factors, and protective factors, similarities or 
      differences with the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and its 
      influence on the central nervous system. RESULTS: The MCR syndrome is 
      characterized by subjective cognitive impairment and a slower gait speed. 
      Compared to healthy adults, adults with the MCR have a higher risk of dementia, 
      falls, and mortality. Modifiable risk factors provide a starting point for 
      specific multimodal lifestyle-related preventive interventions. CONCLUSION: As 
      MCR can be easily diagnosed in practical settings, it could become an important 
      concept for the early detection of adults with an increased risk of dementia in 
      German-speaking countries, although further research is necessary to empirically 
      confirm this assumption.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation may play a role in Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) 
      syndrome, a pre-dementia syndrome comprised of slow gait and cognitive 
      complaints. Our objective was to examine associations of inflammatory biomarkers 
      with MCR. METHODS: We examined association of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) with prevalent MCR using logistic regression in 3,101 older adults 
      (52% female) from five cohorts (National Center for Geriatrics & Gerontology 
      Study of Geriatric Syndromes [NCGG-SGS], Central Control of Mobility in Aging 
      [CCMA], Tasmanian Study of Cognition and Gait [TASCOG], LonGenity, and Einstein 
      Aging Study [EAS]). Associations were reported as odds ratios adjusted for sex, 
      age, education, depressive symptoms, body mass index, and vascular diseases (aOR) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis and analyses stratified by 
      vascular disease were also done. RESULTS: Although associations between higher 
      (worse) CRP and IL-6 tertiles and MCR were only seen in three out of the five 
      cohorts (EAS, TASCOG, and LonGenity), when a pooled meta-analysis was performed, 
      a robust association was demonstrated. In meta-analysis, highest tertiles of IL-6 
      (aOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.01- 2.44) and CRP (aOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.09-2.48) was associated 
      with MCR versus lowest tertiles in the pooled sample. Higher CRP was associated 
      with MCR among those with vascular disease in TASCOG and LonGenity cohorts, and 
      among those without vascular disease in EAS. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and CRP levels are 
      associated with MCR in older adults, and this association varies by presence of 
      vascular disease.

      syndrome.

LID - 10.1111/ene.14271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia 
      condition that combines slow gait and subjective cognitive concerns. As the 
      earliest markers of MCR are relatively unknown, the role of subjective cognitive 
      concerns was investigated to predict incident MCR in a well-characterized 
      prospective cohort of non-demented older adults. METHODS: Non-demented MCR-free 
      older adults (n = 476) from the Central Control of Mobility in Aging cohort 
      completed gait, subjective cognition and neuropsychological assessment at 
      baseline and follow-up. Subjective concerns were analyzed via responses to 12 
      items from three validated measures, the Late-Life Function and Disability 
      Instrument - Disability Component, the Activities of Daily Living Prevention 
      Instrument and the Geriatric Depression Scale, and were independent of items 
      utilized to diagnose MCR. Cox proportional hazard models examined the association 
      between cognitive concerns and incident MCR. RESULTS: After 2.36 ± 1.4 years, 28 
      participants developed MCR. Executive functioning (adjusted hazard ratio 2.458, 
      95% confidence interval 1.094-5.524, P = 0.029) and mental clarity concerns 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 3.917, 95% confidence interval 1.690-9.077, P = 0.001) 
      were associated with incident MCR, controlling for age, sex, education and gait 
      speed. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective cognitive concerns in non-memory cognitive domains 
      predict incident MCR. Although most MCR studies assess cognitive concerns about 
      memory, our findings suggest the need to broaden the scope of subjective 
      cognitive assessment to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and prediction of 
      future cognitive decline.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive syndrome (MCR), a newly described predementia 
      syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait, is associated with 
      increased risk of developing dementia. Due to the potential differences in 
      health, behavioral, and lifestyle factors between races that can influence 
      dementia risk, it is important to examine risk factors for MCR in different 
      countries. This study aimed to report the prevalence as well as modifiable 
      factors associated with MCR in Japanese community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: 
      A cross-sectional design. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 
      9683 older adults (52% women, mean age: 73.6 years) participating in the National 
      Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Study of Geriatric Syndromes. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Participants were screened for presence of MCR at baseline. The association of 
      selected modifiable risk factors (medical illness, depressive symptoms, and 
      falls) and lifestyle variables (obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and 
      alcohol consumption) with MCR was examined using multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: At cross-section, 619 participants met criteria for MCR, with 
      an overall prevalence 6.4% (95% CI 5.9-6.9). A higher prevalence of MCR was seen 
      with advancing age (P < .001), but there were no sex differences. Diabetes 
      (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.47, P = .001), depressive symptoms (OR 3.57, P < 
      .001), and falls (OR 1.45, P < .001) were associated with increased risk of MCR. 
      Among the lifestyle factors, obesity (OR 1.26, P = .018) and physical inactivity 
      (OR 1.57, P < .001) were associated with increased risk of MCR. CONCLUSION: MCR 
      is common in the elderly Japanese population. The potentially modifiable risk and 
      lifestyle factors identified for MCR should be further studied to develop 
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) is a predementia stage where 
      slow gait speed and subjective memory complaints are present. The purpose of this 
      study was to estimate the prevalence of MCR and assess its relationship with 
      sociodemographic factors and chronic conditions. METHODS: This is a secondary 
      analysis of the SABE Colombia study conducted in 2015. The analytic sample 
      consisted of 17·577 participants. After determining MCR prevalence, logistic 
      regression was performed to examine the correlates of MCR. FINDINGS: The 
      prevalence of MCR was 10·71 %. The median age was 71 years and women composed 
      74·63 % of the MCR group. After adjusting for confounding variables MCR was 
      associated with increasing age (OR 1·69, CI 1·43 - 1·92), no or low education (OR 
      1·99, CI 1·67- 2·37), MMSE (OR 0·93, CI 0·91 - 0·95) and chronic conditions such 
      as mental disorders (OR 1·36, CI 1·11-1·67), history of myocardial infarction (OR 
      1·24, CI 1·04 - 1·47), hypertension (OR 1·23, CI 1·08 - 1·40) and diabetes (OR 
      1.18, CI 1.01 - 1.37). INTERPRETATION: This study found a prevalence of 10·71 % 
      of MCR in Colombian older adults. Additionally, MCR was associated with chronic 
      conditions and sociodemographic factors identified in prior studies. These 
      results increase the awareness of a novel predementia stage whose identification 
      can be performed by clinicians in the outpatient clinic, minimizing the cost of a 
      full neuropsychologic evaluation performed in a memory clinic. FUNDING: Funded by 
      the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) 
      and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia.

TI  - Mechanisms of motoric cognitive risk-Hypotheses based on a systematic review and

AB  - We aimed to refine the hypothesis that motoric cognitive risk (MCR), a syndrome 
      combining measured slow gait speed and self-reported cognitive complaints, is 
      prognostic of incident dementia and other major causes of morbidity in older age. 
      We propose mechanisms on the relationship between motor and cognitive function 
      and describe a roadmap to validate these hypotheses. We systematically searched 
      major electronic databases from inception to August 2021 for original 
      longitudinal cohort studies of adults aged ≥60 years that compared an MCR group 
      to a non-MCR group with any health outcome. Fifteen cohorts were combined by 
      meta-analysis. Participants with MCR were at an increased risk of cognitive 
      impairment (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.49-2.08; I(2 ) = 24.9%), 
      dementia (aHR 2.12, 1.85-2.42; 33.1%), falls (adjusted Relative Risk 1.38, 
      1.15-1.66; 62.1%), and mortality (aHR 1.49, 1.16-1.91; 79.2%). The prognostic 
      value of MCR is considerable and mechanisms underlying the syndrome are proposed.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome: Prevalence and Risk of Cognitive Impairment in a 
      Population Studied in the Mexican Health and Aging Study 2012-2015.
PG  - 227-231
LID - 10.1007/s12603-019-1160-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Motoric 
      Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome, describe associated risk factors and to determine 
      the risk of progression to cognitive impairment after three years of follow-up, 
      in a sample of Mexican older adults. DESIGN: A prospective panel study of health 
      and aging in Mexico. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Baseline and follow-up information 
      was obtained from the Mexican Health and Aging Study's 2012 and 2015 waves. A 
      total of 726 subjects aged 60 years or older with normal cognition at baseline 
      were classified into 4 groups: 1) with MCR, 2) with memory complaint only, 3) 
      with slow gait speed only and, 4) without MCR. Cox regression analysis 
      controlling for confounder factors was performed to determine the risk of 
      progression to cognitive impairment in the MCR group. MEASURES: Data such as gait 
      speed, functional status and cognitive performance (standardized by age and sex 
      in Mexican population) was collected. RESULTS: MCR prevalence was 14.3%. When 
      compared with non-MCR subjects, the presence of MCR was associated with older age 
      (p<0.01), lower educational status (p=0.05), having two or more comorbidities 
      (p<0.05) and diabetes mellitus diagnosis (p<0.05). At follow-up and after 
      adjusting for confounders, MCR was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% 
      CI: 1.28-4.26, p=.000) of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: MCR syndrome 
      increases the risk of cognitive impairment in Mexican older adults. Simple 
      measurements such as gait evaluation in subjects with memory complaints could 
      allow early identification of those at risk of developing cognitive impairment.

      Retrospective cohort analysis of two populations.
PG  - 1859-1867
LID - 10.1111/ene.14841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia 
      syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait. MCR is associated 
      with increased risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Predictors of 
      transition to dementia in MCR patients are still obscure. METHODS: We examined 
      clinical, biological and lifestyle parameters related to conversion to dementia 
      using Cox models in 439 older adults with prevalent MCR (mean age 
      79.87 ± 8.13 years, 70% women) from two cohorts, 268 from the Chicago-based Rush 
      Memory and Aging project (MAP) and 171 from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), 
      which enrolled religious clergy across the United States. RESULTS: In the pooled 
      sample, 439 (13.2%) had prevalent MCR (268 MAP and 171 ROS). There were 140 
      (31.9%) incident dementia cases over a median follow up of 4.0 years. Age 
      predicted conversion from MCR to dementia in both cohorts. Male gender was a risk 
      factor only in ROS. In the pooled data, only higher depressive symptoms were 
      associated with higher risk of conversion to dementia (adjusted hazard ratio 
      [aHR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24). Lower cognitive activity participation (aHR 0.59, 
      95% CI 0.44-0.79) and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (aHR 2.57, 95% CI 1.48-4.45) 
      predicted conversion to dementia in MAP. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms and 
      other cohort-specific risk factors were identified as predictors of transition to 
      dementia in individuals with MCR. These findings suggest common pathological 
      mechanisms underlying mood, gait and cognitive declines in aging, which could 
      help develop preventive strategies.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome and Falls Risk: A Multi-Center Study.
PG  - 1043-52
LID - 10.3233/JAD-160230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) is characterized by slow 
      gait speed and cognitive complaints. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was 
      to determine if the presence of MCR increases the risk of falls in older people. 
      METHODS: Individual participant data (n = 6,204) from five longitudinal studies 
      from three countries were used for this analysis. MCR diagnosis was defined as 
      both the presence of objectively measured slow gait speed and subjective 
      cognitive complaints in those without dementia or mobility disability. Falls were 
      prospectively ascertained using phone calls or questionnaires. Log binomial 
      regression was performed to determine if MCR increased the risk of falls 
      separately in each cohort. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results 
      from all cohorts. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 74.9 (SD 6.8) years 
      and 44% (n = 2728) were male. Overall 33.9% (n = 2104) reported a fall over 
      follow-up. Pooled relative risk of MCR with any falls was RR 1.44 95% CI 1.16, 
      1.79. The components of MCR, slow gait (RR 1.30 95% CI 1.14, 1.47) and cognitive 
      complaint (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07, 1.46) were also associated with an increased 
      risk of any falls. In sub-analyses MCR was associated with any fall independent 
      of previous falls (RR 1.29 95% CI 1.09, 1.53) and with multiple falls (RR 1.77, 
      95% CI 1.25, 2.51). CONCLUSION: MCR is associated with an increased risk of 
      falls. The increase in risk was higher than for its individual components. The 
      simplicity of the MCR makes it an attractive falls risk screening tool for the 
      clinic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is associated with increased mortality. We 
      examined the association between motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, a 
      predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaints, and 
      survival. METHODS: A total of 11,867 nondemented participants aged >65 years from 
      three established cohort studies in the United States and Europe were screened 
      for MCR. Mortality risk of MCR was assessed with Cox and logistic regression 
      models. RESULTS: At baseline, 836 (7.0%) participants had MCR. Over a median 
      follow-up of 28 months, 1603 participants died (758 in first 2 years). MCR was 
      associated with increased mortality overall (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.46-1.96) and 2-year mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 
      1.89; 95% CI, 1.50-2.38). The association remained after accounting for 
      established mortality risk factors as well as baseline gait speed and memory 
      performance. DISCUSSION: MCR is associated with increased mortality. Older adults 
      should be screened for MCR to identify at-risk individuals for dementia and 
      death.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome in a 
      community-dwelling older Scottish population: A longitudinal observational study.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5824 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) is a gait-based predementia syndrome 
      that is easy to measure and prognostic of dementia and falls. We aimed to examine 
      the prevalence and risk factors for MCR, and assess its overlap with Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment, Prefrailty, and Frailty, in a cohort of older Scottish 
      adults without dementia. METHODS: In this longitudinal prospective study, we 
      classified 690 participants (mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years; wave 3) of the 
      Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) into non-MCR or MCR groups. We examined their 
      baseline (age 69.5 [0.8] years; wave 1) risk factors for MCR at waves 3, 4, and 5 
      (6, 9, and 12 years later respectively). RESULTS: MCR prevalence rate ranged from 
      5.3% to 5.7% across the three waves. The presence of MCR was associated with 
      older baseline age (6 and 9 years later), lower occupational socioeconomic status 
      (6 years later), and worse scores in a range of tests of executive function (6, 9 
      and 12 years later). Approximately 46% of the MCR group also had Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment, and almost everyone in the MCR group had either Prefrailty or 
      Frailty. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MCR in this Scottish cohort is lower than 
      the pooled global average, possibly reflecting the general good health of the LBC 
      cohort. However, it is higher than the prevalence in two neighbouring countries' 
      cohorts, which may reflect the younger average ages of those cohorts. Future 
      LBC1936 research should assess the risk factors associated with MCR to validate 
      previous findings and analyse novel predictive factors, particularly 
      socioeconomic status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, characterized by slow gait 
      and cognitive complaints, is a high risk for transitioning to dementia. However, 
      little is known regarding the cognitive profile among individuals with MCR. This 
      study was performed to examine the association of MCR with cognitive functional 
      domains. METHODS: We analyzed 2881 community-dwelling older adults aged 70-84 
      years (52 % women, mean age: 75.9 years) from the nationwide Korean Frailty and 
      Aging Cohort Study. MCR was defined as the presence of subjective cognitive 
      complaints and slow gait ≥ 1.0 standard deviations below age- and sex-specific 
      means. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean version of the Consortium 
      to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet and the Frontal 
      Assessment Battery. RESULTS: A total of 231 participants met MCR criteria 
      (prevalence = 8.02 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7.07-9.08 %). The prevalence 
      of MCR did not increase with advancing age: 70-74 years, 8.90 %; 75-79 years, 
      7.06 %; and 80-84 years, 8.04 %; moreover, there were no sex-related differences. 
      After adjusting for various confounders, MCR was associated with decline in 
      global cognitive function, attention, processing speed and executive function 
      (all P < 0.05). In particular, MCR was significantly associated with impairments 
      in processing speed (odds ratio [OR]: 1.89, 95 % CI: 1.16-3.07) and executive 
      function (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.28-2.93) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCR was 
      associated with deficits in global cognition, processing speed, and executive 
      function, but not delayed free recall memory. Individuals with MCR had an 
      increased risk of poor cognitive profile related to brain frontal and prefrontal 
      function.

TI  - The association of motoric cognitive risk with incident dementia and neuroimaging 
      characteristics: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.
PG  - 434-444
LID - 10.1002/alz.12412 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR), a clinical syndrome characterized by 
      slow gait speed and subjective cognitive complaints, has been associated with 
      dementia risk. The neuropathological features underlying MCR remain poorly 
      understood. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) 
      community-based cohort study classified participants using standardized criteria 
      as MCR+/- and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)+/- at study baseline (2011-2013). 
      We examined the 5-year dementia risk and baseline brain structural/molecular 
      abnormalities associated with MCR+ and MCI+ status. RESULTS: Of 5023 nondemented 
      participants included, 204 were MCR+ and 1030 were MCI+. Both MCR+ and MCI+ 
      participants demonstrated increased dementia risk. The pattern of structural 
      brain abnormalities associated with MCR+ differed from that of MCI+. Whereas MCI+ 
      was associated with comparatively smaller volumes in brain regions vulnerable to 
      Alzheimer's disease pathology, MCR+ status was associated with smaller volumes in 
      frontoparietal regions and greater white matter abnormalities. DISCUSSION: MCR 
      may represent a predementia syndrome characterized by prominent white matter 
      abnormalities and frontoparietal atrophy.

AB  - Brain aging is characterized by the declines in motor and cognitive features. The 
      present study is to detect motor cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) in older adults 
      with white matter lesions (WML). 134 WML aged patients were recruited and 
      diagnosed with the criteria for MCRS. Numerous cognitive function tests and 
      walking tests were performed. The frequency of MCRS is 28.35%. Verbal fluency 
      test, Mini-Mental State Examination, and dual-task walking speed were independent 
      risk factor of MCRS. These findings indicated that MCRS was common in WML 
      seniors. MCRS was associated with the pathologies of WML in older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia stage, which 
      associates slow walking speed with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). MCR's 
      clinical utility for the prediction of dementia and its pathophysiology are 
      unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the 
      association of MCR with incident cognitive impairment, cognitive performance and 
      brain structures. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using the Medical 
      Subject Heading terms "Walking" and "Cognition disorders" combined with the terms 
      "Subjective cognitive impairment", "Subjective cognitive decline" and "Motoric 
      cognitive risk". A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review and 
      meta-analysis: 3 studies had dementia as the outcome, 3 studies had cognitive 
      performance as the outcome, 4 studies had brain structures as the outcome and one 
      study examined the incidence of both major neurocognitive disorders and cognitive 
      impairment. RESULTS: MCR was found to be associated with incident cognitive 
      impairment (pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.46-1.98 with P-value 
      <0.001) and dementia (pooled HR = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.75-2.39 with P-value <0.001). 
      MCR was also found to be associated with low grey matter volume involving the 
      premotor and the prefrontal cortex, and lacunar lesions in the frontal lobe. No 
      significant association was found with white matter abnormalities. CONCLUSION: 
      MCR predicts cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that it may be used as 
      a screening syndrome for dementia in a primary care setting. Its significant 
      association with both low grey matter volume and lacunar lesions makes its 
      pathophysiology unclear and suggests multiple pathways.

TI  - Socioeconomic status as a risk factor for motoric cognitive risk syndrome in a 
      community-dwelling population: A longitudinal observational study.
PG  - 1191-1199
LID - 10.1111/ene.15731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a syndrome characterised by measured 
      slow gait speed and self-reported cognitive complaints. MCR is a high-risk state 
      for adverse health outcomes in older adults, particularly cognitive impairment 
      and dementia. Previous studies have identified risk factors for MCR, but the 
      effect of socioeconomic status has, to date, been insufficiently examined. This 
      study explored the association between MCR and socioeconomic status, as 
      determined by occupational social class and years of education. METHODS: Some 692 
      community-based adults of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936), aged 70 years 
      at baseline, were followed up after 6 years and classified into non-MCR and MCR 
      groups. We applied logistic regression analyses adjusting for demographic, 
      lifestyle, and health covariates to investigate the association between MCR and 
      years of education and occupational social class, categorised into manual versus 
      non-manual occupations. RESULTS: MCR prevalence at age 76 years was 5.6% (95% CI 
      4.0-7.6). After multivariate adjustment, participants of lower socioeconomic 
      status (manual occupation) had a greater than three-fold increased likelihood of 
      MCR (adjusted odds ratio 3.55, 95% CI 1.46-8.74; p = 0.005) compared with those 
      of higher socioeconomic status (non-manual occupation). CONCLUSIONS: Working in a 
      manual job earlier in life triples the risk of MCR later in life, regardless of 
      education. Unravelling this association will likely reveal important 
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MCR and may unearth modifiable risk 
      factors which could be targeted to reduce the incidence of MCR and, ultimately, 
      dementia. Policy and healthcare practice addressing dementia risks such as MCR in 
      their social context and early in the lifecourse could be effective strategies 
      for reducing health inequalities in older age.

      follow-up: evidence from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 831-838
LID - 10.1111/ene.15677 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Slower gait speed and subjective cognitive concerns are 
      characteristics of the motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome. This study aimed to 
      examine if changes in pain may be hallmarks of early MCR, through investigating 
      the magnitude of the association of chronic pain and the risk of MCR at 4 years 
      follow-up. METHODS: In total, 3711 participants without dementia or any mobility 
      disability aged ≥60 years were studied, including 1413 with chronic pain, 
      enrolled in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a prospective 
      cohort study. MCR assessed at wave 1 (2011) and wave 3 (2015) was used as the 
      exposure. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the longitudinal 
      association between chronic pain and MCR after adjusting for individual factors, 
      behaviors/physiology factors and societal factors. Four years later, the incident 
      MCR was evaluated. RESULTS: After adjusting for individual factors, chronic pain 
      was found to increase the risk of MCR development over time by about 1.5 times 
      (hazard ratio 1.562, 95% confidence interval 1.228-1.986; p < 0.001) and to be 
      linked with incident MCR at baseline (odds ratio 1.397, 95% confidence interval 
      1.149-1.698; p < 0.001). These associations remained substantial when 
      behaviors/physiology factors and societal factors were taken into account in the 
      analytical models. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study imply that incident MCR 
      may be exacerbated by chronic pain. Further exploration is required to find out 
      whether chronic pain is a modifiable risk factor for MCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), which combines Subjective 
      Cognitive Complaint (SCC) and slow gait speed in individuals free of dementia and 
      gait disability, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and diseases as 
      well as incident cognitive impairment. Little information on MCR exists in the 
      Canadian population. This study aims to examine these associations in 
      community-dwelling elderly people living in Quebec, which is a Canadian province. 
      METHODS: Data was collected from the"Nutrition as a determinant of successful 
      aging: The Quebec longitudinal study" (NuAge), which is a Quebec population-based 
      observational cohort study with 3 years of follow-up. A subset of 1113 
      participants (age 73.8 ± 4.1 and 51.9% female; 63.5% of the initial NuAge sample) 
      was selected. MCR, cardiovascular risk factors and disease were recorded at 
      baseline. Incident cognitive impairment was considered if the Modified 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) score was ≤79/100 at subsequent annual 
      visits. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR was 4.2% at baseline and was significantly 
      associated with diabetes (P < 0.032), cerebrovascular disease (P < 0.043) and 
      incident cognitive impairment (P ≤ 0.001). The overall incidence of cognitive 
      impairment during the 3-year follow-up period was 4.6%. A greater decrease of the 
      3MS score was observed in participants with MCR compared to those without MCR, at 
      each annual assessment (P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: MCR was associated with diabetes 
      and cerebrovascular diseases at baseline, and incident cognitive impairment in 
      NuAge study participants.

LID - 10.1111/ene.15476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a gait-based 
      pre-dementia syndrome associated with risk of dementia. Ascertaining subjective 
      cognitive and motoric complaints may facilitate early and remote identification 
      of individuals with MCR as they are reported to precede and predict objective 
      cognitive and motoric impairments in aging. METHODS: The validity of five 
      subjective motoric complaint (SMC) questions and 10 subjective cognitive 
      complaint (SCC) questions was examined for discriminating MCR in 538 non-demented 
      community-dwelling adults. Backward logistic regression was used to identify 
      questions to develop a weighted score to define subjective MCR (MCR-S). Receiver 
      operating characteristic analysis was applied to determine the discriminative 
      ability of MCR-S for the objective MCR (MCR-O) definition based on SCCs and 
      objectively measured gait. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential 
      confounders were used to examine the predictive validity of MCR-S for incident 
      dementia. RESULTS: Five subjective complaint questions (three SCC and two SMC) 
      were associated with MCR-O. They were combined to define an MCR-S score (range 
      0-7) which yielded an area under the curve of 0.89 for discriminating MCR-O from 
      receiver operating characteristic analysis. An optimal cut-score of 2 on the 
      MCR-S score was determined to have good sensitivity (84%) and specificity (82%) 
      for MCR-O. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 29 participants developed 
      dementia. Both MCR-S (adjusted hazard ratio 2.39) and MCR-O at baseline (adjusted 
      hazard ratio 3.16) predicted risk of incident dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective 
      MCR had high concordance with MCR-O and can provide a remote screening assessment 
      for MCR-O, which can identify those at high risk for dementia.

TI  - Slow Gait, Subjective Cognitive Decline and Motoric Cognitive RISK Syndrome: 
      Prevalence and Associated Factors in Community Dwelling Older Adults.
PG  - 48-56
LID - 10.1007/s12603-020-1525-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR), slow gait speed (SG) and 
      subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are known to be harbingers of dementia. MCR is 
      known to be associated with a 3-fold increased risk of future dementia, while SG 
      can precede cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine the prevalence 
      and demographics of MCR, slow gait alone (SG-A) and subjective cognitive decline 
      alone (SCD-A) in community-dwelling older adults and association with physical, 
      functional, cognition and psychosocial factors. METHODS: A total of 509 
      participants were classified into four groups according to presence of SG and/or 
      SCD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated 
      with SG-A, SCD-A and MCR. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR was 13.6%, SG-A 13.0% 
      and SCD-A 35.0%. Prevalence of MCR doubled every decade in females with 27.7% of 
      female ≥ 80 years old had MCR. Almost 4 in 10 had no SG or SCD (SG+SCD negative). 
      MCR and SG-A groups were significantly older, had higher body mass index (BMI), 
      lower education, lower global cognition scores especially in non-memory domains, 
      higher prevalence of low grip strength and lower short physical performance 
      battery scores than those with SCD-A and SG+SCD negative. In addition, the SG-A 
      group had significantly higher prevalence of multi-morbidity and diabetes. The 
      prevalence of pain, depression, frailty, social isolation and activity of daily 
      living impairment were significantly higher in MCR. The global cognitive and 
      functional scores for those with SCD-A were comparable to the SG+SCD negative 
      group. The Malay ethnic group had the lowest prevalence of SCD but highest 
      prevalence of SG. After adjusting for confounding factors, age, BMI, frailty 
      status, instrumental activity of daily living, depression and pain remained 
      significantly associated with MCR. For SG-A, age, BMI, education and number of 
      chronic diseases remained significant. CONCLUSION: Both MCR and SG-A are 
      associated with global cognitive decline especially in the non-memory domains and 
      lower functional scores. Gait speed is a good predictor of negative outcomes and 
      should be considered as the 'sixth' vital sign. Long term prospective studies are 
      needed to evaluate: i) the conversion to dementia in different ethnic groups and 
      ii) effect of targeted physical and / or dual task exercise on delaying the 
      conversion to dementia and / or improvement in physical measures and reduction of 
      disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a newly proposed predementia 
      syndrome incorporating subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait. Previous 
      studies have reported that subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait are 
      associated with frailty in cognitively unimpaired older adults, but little is 
      known about the link between MCR and frailty in older adults. Therefore, the aim 
      of the study was to explore the associations of MCR and its components with 
      frailty in older Chinese adults. METHODS: In an observational cross-sectional 
      study, a total of 429 older adults aged 60 years and older were admitted to the 
      geriatric department. According to MCR criteria, all participants were classified 
      into 4 groups: 1) the MCR group; 2) the subjective cognitive complaints only 
      group; 3) the slow gait only group; and 4) the healthy control group. Physical 
      frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis was used to examine the association between MCR and frailty 
      in older adults. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of subjective cognitive 
      complaints, slow gait and MCR were 15.9, 10.0 and 4.0%, respectively. After 
      adjusting for confounding variables, the logistic regression analysis showed that 
      slow gait (odds ratio [OR]: 3.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-8.23, 
      P = 0.007) and MCR (OR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.46-20.89, P = 0.012) were independently 
      associated with frailty, but subjective cognitive complaints were not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MCR and slow gait were significantly associated with frailty in 
      older Chinese adults. Further studies should prospectively determine the causal 
      relationship between MCR and frailty.

      biological insights and to develop preventive strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to examine the association of MCR with incidence of dementia and disability 
      in a Japanese community-dwelling sample of older adults. METHODS: Participants 
      were 4,235 older adults (50% women, mean age: 72.0 years). MCR was diagnosed at 
      baseline using established criteria in non-demented seniors with self-reported 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait. Incident cases of dementia were identified 
      from insurance data monthly. Disability was regarded as certification by 
      long-term care insurance. RESULTS: At baseline, 265 participants (6.3%) met 
      criteria for MCR. During follow-up (mean duration: 29 months), there were 138 
      incident cases of dementia (3.3%) and 207 incident cases of disability (4.9%). 
      Cox-proportional hazards models, adjusted for demographical data, lifestyle, and 
      medical conditions, showed that presence of MCR at baseline was a major risk 
      factor for developing dementia (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.52-4.10, p < 0.001). MCR also 
      predicted risk for disability (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.08-2.02, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: MCR is helpful in the short-term prediction of risk for dementia and 
      disability in the elderly Japanese population. Identification of seniors with MCR 
      is recommended for early detection and instituting preventive measures for 
      reducing the risk of dementia and disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, defined as the coexistence 
      of slow gait and subjective cognitive complaints, has as yet not been researched 
      in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of 
      the MCR syndrome in pwMS and its association with disability, disease duration, 
      perceived fatigue, and fear of falling. METHODS: The study comprised 618 pwMS 
      [43.7 (SD = 12.6) years, 61.7% females]. Gait speed was measured by the GAITRite™ 
      electronic walkway (CIR Systems, Inc. Haverton, PA, USA). Cognitive status was 
      defined according to the global cognitive score computed by the NeuroTrax™ 
      cognitive battery (NeuroTrax Corporation, Medina, NY, USA). The sample was 
      divided into four main groups: 'normal', 'cognitively impaired', 'gait impaired' 
      or 'MCR'. Perceived fatigue was assessed by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; 
      fear of falling by the Falls Efficacy Scale International. RESULTS: Sixty-three 
      (10.2%) patients were diagnosed with MCR. The percentage of subjects categorized 
      as MCR was 26.0% in severely disabled pwMS compared with 10.9%, 6.0%, and 4.6% in 
      moderately, mildly and very mildly disabled pwMS, respectively. Subjects in the 
      MCR group presented with elevated fatigue compared with patients classified as 
      normal [49.7 (SD = 23.3) vs 26.5 (SD = 19.2), p < 0.001]. Fear of falling was 
      significantly higher in the MCR and gait impairment groups compared with the 
      cognitively impaired and normal groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current study 
      corroborates the presence of MCR in pwMS. Nevertheless, future longitudinal 
      research is warranted to better understand its application.

PG  - 794-e56
LID - 10.1111/ene.13891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment, slow walking speed and motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) have separately been associated with an increased 
      risk for mortality in the short term. The aim of the study was to examine the 
      association of MCR and its components [i.e. subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) 
      and slow walking speed] with short-, medium- and long-term mortality in older 
      community-dwellers. METHODS: In all, 3778 participants from the Epidémiologie de 
      l'Ostéoporose (EPIDOS) study were selected. MCR was defined as the combination of 
      slow walking speed and SCC in participants without major neurocognitive 
      disorders. Deaths were prospectively recorded using mail, phone calls, 
      questionnaires and/or the French national death registry at 5, 10, 15 and 19 (end 
      of follow-up period) years. RESULTS: Over the follow-up of 19 years, 80.5% 
      (n = 3043) participants died. Slow walking speed and MCR were associated with 
      mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.20 with P = 0.004 for slow walking speed and HR = 
      1.26 with P = 0.002 for MCR at 10 years; HR = 1.27 with P ≤ 0.001 for slow 
      walking speed and HR = 1.22 with P = 0.001 for MCR at 15 years; HR = 1.41 with 
      P ≤ 0.001 at 19 years for slow walking speed and MCR]. There was no association 
      between SCC and mortality. Kaplan-Meier distributions of mortality showed that 
      participants with MCR and slow walking speed died earlier compared to healthy 
      participants and those with SCC (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Slow walking speed and 
      MCR were associated with an increased risk for mortality at the medium and long 
      term, whereas no association was found with SCC.

TI  - Longitudinal associations between falls and future risk of cognitive decline, the 
      Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome and dementia: the Einstein Ageing Study.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac058 [doi]
LID - afac058
AB  - BACKGROUND: falls share risk factors with cognitive decline but whether falls 
      predict cognitive decline, pre-dementia syndromes and dementia is poorly 
      understood. OBJECTIVES: this study aimed to examine if falls are associated with 
      cognitive decline in specific domains and the risk of Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      (MCR) syndrome and dementia. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. METHODS: in older 
      people (age 80.6 ± 5.3 years) free of dementia at baseline, the number of falls 
      (none, one or multiple) during the year before enrolment and the first year of 
      follow-up (exposure) were recorded. Decline in specific cognitive functions 
      (global cognition, episodic verbal memory, verbal fluency, working memory, 
      response inhibition and processing speed-attention), incident MCR and incident 
      dementia were outcome measures. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine 
      the associations between falls and cognitive decline, adjusting for confounders. 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine if falls predicted risk of 
      incident MCR or dementia. RESULTS: of 522 eligible participants, 140 had a single 
      fall and 70 had multiple falls. Multiple falls were associated with a greater 
      decline in global cognition, episodic memory, verbal fluency and processing 
      speed-attention compared to those with no falls (P < 0.05). Over a median 
      follow-up of 1.0 years 36 participants developed MCR and 43 participants 
      developed dementia. Those with multiple falls had a two-fold increased risk of 
      MCR compared to those with no falls, but no increased risk of developing 
      dementia. CONCLUSIONS: multiple falls may be an important marker to identify 
      older people at greater risk of future cognitive decline and incident MCR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prediction nomogram based on motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome for cognitive impairment in healthy older adults. 
      METHODS: Using two longitudinal cohorts of participants (aged ≥ 60 years) with 
      4-year follow-up, we developed (n = 1,177) and validated (n = 2,076) a prediction 
      nomogram. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression 
      model and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used for variable selection 
      and for developing the prediction model, respectively. The performance of the 
      nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination, and 
      clinical usefulness. RESULTS: The individualized prediction nomogram was assessed 
      based on the following: motoric cognitive risk syndrome, education, gender, 
      baseline cognition, and age. The model showed good discrimination [Harrell's 
      concordance index (C-index) of 0.814; 95% confidence interval, 0.782-0.835] and 
      good calibration. Comparable results were also seen in the validation cohort, 
      which includes good discrimination (C-index, 0.772; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.776-0.818) and good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the 
      prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: This prediction nomogram 
      provides a practical tool with all necessary predictors, which are accessible to 
      practitioners. It can be used to estimate the risk of cognitive impairment in 
      healthy older adults.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome: Could It Be Defined Through Increased 
      Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test Time, Rather Than Slow Walking Speed?
PG  - 434
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00434 [doi]
LID - 434
AB  - Background: Slow walking speed, time to perform the five-times-sit-to-stand 
      (FTSS) test and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR; defined as slow gait speed 
      combined with subjective cognitive complaint) have been separately used to screen 
      older individuals at risk of cognitive decline. This study seeks to (1) compare 
      the characteristics of older individuals with MCR, as defined through slow 
      walking speed and/or increased FTSS time; and (2) examine the relationship 
      between MCR and its motor components as well as amnestic (a-MCI) and non-amnestic 
      (na-MCI) Mild Cognitive Impairment. Methods: A total of 633, individuals free of 
      dementia, were selected from the cross-sectional "Gait and Alzheimer Interactions 
      Tracking" study. Slow gait speed and increased FTSS time were used as criteria 
      for the definition of MCR. Participants were separated into five groups, 
      according to MCR status: MCR as defined by (1) slow gait speed exclusively 
      (MCRs); (2) increased FTSS time exclusively (MCRf); (3) slow gait speed and 
      increased FTSS time (MCRsaf); (4) MCR; irrespective of the mobility test used 
      (MCRsof); and (5) the absence of MCR. Cognitive status (i.e., a-MCI, na-MCI, 
      cognitively healthy) was also determined. Results: The prevalence of MCRs was 
      higher, when compared to the prevalence of MCRf (12.0% versus 6.2% with P ≤ 
      0.001). There existed infrequent overlap (2.4%) between individuals exhibiting 
      MCRs and MCRf, and frequent overlap between individuals exhibiting MCRs and 
      na-MCI (up to 50%). a-MCI and na-MCI were negatively [odd ratios (OR) ≤ 0.17 with 
      P ≤ 0.019] and positively (OR ≥ 2.41 with P ≤ 0.019) related to MCRs, 
      respectively. Conclusion: Individuals with MCRf are distinct from those with 
      MCRs. MCRf status does not relate to MCI status in the same way that MCRs does. 
      MCRs is related negatively to a-MCI and positively to na-MCI. These results 
      suggest that FTTS cannot be used to define MCR when the goal is to predict the 
      risk of cognitive decline, such as future dementia.

AB  - Background: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is considered to be a 
      pre-dementia syndrome. Although an increasing number of studies have begun to 
      focus on this syndrome, few investigations have been launched in China. This 
      study was performed to examine the prevalence and correlates of MCR in China. 
      Methods: We included 5,725 adults aged over 60 years from China Health and 
      Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). MCR was defined as the presence of 
      subjective cognitive complaints and a gait speed ≤20th percentile of the weighted 
      population distribution adjusted for sex and height. The associations among 
      selected modifiable associated factors and clinical measures with MCR were 
      examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 
      participants, 414 met the criteria for MCR with an overall prevalence 7.29% (95% 
      CI: 6.62-7.96%). MCR was found to be more prevalent among women than men (9.73 vs 
      4.85%), and more prevalent among participants ≥75 years than those <75 years 
      (7.85 vs 5.23%). After multivariable adjustment, lower or upper extremity 
      functional limitations, activities of daily living (ADL) disabilities, weak grip 
      strength, exhaustion, and history of hypertension were found to be significantly 
      associated with MCR. The multivariate analysis also showed higher levels of 
      cystatin C and C-reactive protein were associated with increased odds for MCR. 
      Conclusions: The present study showed that MCR syndrome is highly prevalent among 
      Chinese community-dwelling older adults, and revealed several factors that were 
      correlated with MCR. Longitudinal studies are warranted to further explore the 
      modifiable risk factors of MCR.

TI  - Prevalence/potential risk factors for motoric cognitive risk and its relationship 
      to falls in elderly Chinese people: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 2680-2687
LID - 10.1111/ene.14884 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is characterized by 
      slow walking speed and subjective memory complaints (SMCs). This study 
      investigated the prevalence and potential risk factors of MCR and its association 
      with falls in Chinese community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: The analysis was 
      based on data from the Rugao Longevity and Aging Study (RuLAS). MCR was defined 
      as the presence of both SMCs and slow walking speed in participants free of major 
      neurocognitive disorders. SMCs were determined according to a positive answer to 
      the question 'Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most?' in the 
      15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Slow walking speed was defined as one 
      standard deviation or more below the mean value for patients' age and sex. Data 
      on falls were derived from a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      of SMCs, slow walking speed and MCR in the RuLAS cohort (N = 1592) was 51.9%, 
      15.6% and 8.3%, respectively. After adjusting for other covariates, an occupation 
      of farming (odds ratio [OR] 2.358, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-5.521, 
      p = 0.048), history of cerebrovascular disease (OR 2.215, 95% CI 1.032-4.752, 
      p = 0.041) and hospitalization (OR 2.008, 95% CI 1.120-3.602, p = 0.019) were 
      risk factors for MCR. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk 
      of falls was increased by MCR (OR 1.547, 95% CI 1.009-2.371), SMC (OR 1.308, 95% 
      CI 1.003-1.707) and slow walking speed (OR 1.442, 95% CI 1.030-2.017). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of potential risk factors of MCR can prevent 
      the occurrence of adverse health events such as falls in the elderly.

TI  - Purpose in Life and Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome: Replicable Evidence from Two 
      National Samples.
PG  - 381-388
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16852 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is characterized by 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait speed in the absence of dementia. Consistent 
      evidence indicates that it predicts dementia and premature mortality. Less is 
      known about its antecedents, particularly the role of psychological function. 
      Purpose in life is an aspect of well-being that reflects a goal-oriented and 
      -driven life that has been implicated in cognitive aging. We aimed to examine the 
      cross-sectional association between purpose in life and MCR and to test the 
      hypothesis that purpose is associated with a lower risk of new cases of MCR over 
      an up to 12-year follow-up. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-cohort 
      design. SETTING: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and 
      Aging Trends Study (NHATS). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6,785 individuals from the 
      HRS and 5,665 from the NHATS. MEASUREMENTS: Participants reported on their 
      purpose in life and cognitive complaints and completed a walking speed 
      assessment. Cognitive complaints and walking speed were assessed again up to 
      12 years later in HRS and up to 7 years later in NHATS. RESULTS: Higher purpose 
      in life was associated with a 33% lower risk of MCR concurrently (meta-analytic 
      odds ratio = .75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .62-.90; P = .002) and an about 
      26% lower risk of incident MCR longitudinally (meta-analytic hazard ratio = .77; 
      95% CI = .70-.84; P < .001). These associations were significant in each sample, 
      were independent of sociodemographic covariates, and persisted after controlling 
      for personality and health-related factors (depressive symptoms, physical 
      activity, disease burden). CONCLUSION: Purpose in life is associated with a lower 
      risk of incident MCR, an association that was replicated in two independent 
      samples. Purpose is a malleable aspect of psychological function that is a 
      promising target of intervention for healthier cognitive aging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is characterized by slow gait 
      and memory complaints that could be used to predict an increased risk of 
      dementia. This study aims to determine the MCR syndrome and its risk factors 
      among low-income (B40) older adults in Malaysia. METHODS: Data from TUA cohort 
      study involving 1366 older adults (aged 60 years and above) categorized as 
      low-income were analysed, for risk of MCR syndrome based on defined criteria. 
      Chi-square analysis and independent t test were employed to examine differences 
      in socioeconomic, demographic, chronic diseases and lifestyle factors between MCR 
      and non-MCR groups. Risk factors of MCR syndrome were determined using 
      hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 3.4% of participants 
      fulfilled the criteria of MCR syndrome. Majority of them were female (74.5%, 
      p = 0.001), single/widow/widower/divorced (55.3%, p = 0.002), living in rural 
      area (72.3%, p = 0.011), older age (72.74 ± 7.08 year old, p <  0.001) and had 
      lower years of education (3.26 ± 2.91 years, p = 0.001) than non-MCR group. After 
      adjustment for age, gender and years of education, participants living in rural 
      area (Adjusted OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.10-4.35, p = 0.026), with obesity (Adjusted 
      OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.70-8.57, p = 0.001), diabetes (Adjusted OR = 2.04, 95% 
      CI = 1.01-4.11, p = 0.046), heart disease (Adjusted OR = 2.50, 95% 
      CI = 1.00-6.20, p = 0.049) and cancer (Adjusted OR = 6.57, 95% CI = 1.18-36.65, 
      p = 0.032) were associated with increased risk of MCR syndrome. CONCLUSION: Only 
      3.4% of older adults from low-income group were identified as having MCR 
      syndrome. Women, those living in rural areas, had obesity, diabetes, heart 
      disease and cancer were more likely to have MCR syndrome. Further investigation 
      on MCR as a predementia syndrome will help in development of preventive 
      strategies and interventions to reduce the growing burden of dementia, especially 
      among individuals with low socioeconomic status.

AB  - The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a predementia syndrome associated 
      with dementia and mortality risk. This longitudinal study aimed to investigated 
      the longitudinal association between MCR and falls in older adults, including 
      3,720 participants in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A total 
      of 482 participants (13.0%) met the MCR requirements at baseline. There were 226 
      incident cases of MCR (13.0%) throughout follow-up (duration: 4 years). 
      Controlling for microsystem factors, a single fall (OR: 2.412, 95 % CI: 
      1.100-5.290; p < .05) was associated with incident MCR at baseline and to almost 
      2.0 times (HR: 2.021, 95 % CI: 1.031-3.961; p < .05) more inclined to develop MCR 
      over time, compared to those without falls. These associations remained 
      significant when meso/ exosystem factors and macrosystem factors were included in 
      the analytic models. Falls may be useful in predicting MCR risk in the near 
      future among Chinese older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) was characterized by slow 
      gait and subjective cognitive complaints. MCR was associated with brain 
      structural changes. However, the association between white matter 
      hyperintensities (WMH) and MCR was unclear and the aim of this study was to 
      examine this association. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study participants were 1227 
      older adults (mean age: 72.0 ± 6.0 yrs, women: 52.6%). We collected magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) data to assess WMH. To assess MCR, data on gait speed and 
      subjective cognitive complaints were collected. Demographical and medical data 
      was collected as covariates. RESULTS: Among participants, the proportion of MCR 
      was 5.0% (n = 61) and severe WMH was 16.8% (n = 206). From logistic regression 
      analysis, severe WMH associated with MCR even when adjusted for covariates (odds 
      ratio 2.18 [95% confidential interval 1.15-4.16], p = 0.017). This association 
      was observed in subgroups stratified by the participants' characteristics: higher 
      age, not having fall history, not obesity, not being physical inactivity and not 
      having depressive symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that vascular 
      pathophysiological changes in the brain were associated with MCR. The association 
      was pronounced by several factors. Further evaluation was required to clarify 
      pathophysiology of MCR.

      population: Results of the NuAge cohort study.
PG  - 930943
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.930943 [doi]
LID - 930943
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening older adults at risk of hospitalization is essential to 
      prevention of this adverse event. Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) has been 
      associated with incident dementia and falls, which are both risk factors of 
      hospitalization. There is no information on the association of MCR with incident 
      hospitalization in older adults. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to examine the 
      association of MCR with incident hospitalization in community-dwelling older 
      adults. DESIGN: Quebec older population-based observational cohort study with 3 
      years of follow-up. SETTING: Community dwellings. SUBJECTS: A subset of 999 
      participants recruited in the NuAge study. METHODS: Participants with MCR (i.e., 
      with slow gait and cognitive complaint without dementia or motor disability) were 
      identified at baseline assessment. Incident hospitalization (i.e., ≥1) and its 
      recurrence (i.e., ≥2) were collected annually over a 3 year follow-up period. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR was 5.0% at baseline. The overall incidence of 
      hospitalization was 29.0% and its recurrence 4.8%. MCR was associated with 
      incident recurrent hospitalization [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 2.58 with 95% 
      Confidence Interval (CI) = (1.09-6.09) and P = 0.031], but not with incident 
      hospitalization [aHR = 1.48, with 95%CI = (0.95-2.28) and P = 0.081]. CONCLUSION: 
      MCR is associated with incident recurrent hospitalization in NuAge participants, 
      suggesting that MCR may be of clinical interest for screening individuals at risk 
      for hospitalization in Quebec's older population.

      Speed: Protocol for a Systematic Review.
PG  - 858950
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.858950 [doi]
LID - 858950
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults with motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome are at high 
      risk of developing dementia. Although the definition of MCR is well recognized 
      and consensus, previous studies did not reach an agreement on diagnostic criteria 
      and measurement methods/tools for slow gait speed, which is one of four 
      components of MCR diagnosis. The substantial heterogeneity in the methodology of 
      slow gait speed diagnosis for MCR limits comparability and meta-analysis of 
      studies. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to conduct systematic and standardized 
      integration for diagnostic criteria and methods of slow gait speed diagnosis for 
      MCR based on previous evidence that may improve comparability between future 
      studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review will be undertaken by searching 
      the following electronic databases (until February 1, 2022): PUBMED, EMBASE, The 
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science. Additional studies will be identified by 
      checking the reference lists of included studies or relevant reviews, manually 
      searching the internet search engine Google Scholar, and searching the authors' 
      personal files, if necessary. Two researchers will perform data extraction 
      independently, and discrepancies will be resolved by discussion, which will 
      include a third researcher if requires. The paper selection will perform in 
      duplicate. Finally, a narrative account will synthesize the findings to answer 
      the objectives of this review. DISCUSSION: This is the first study on systematic 
      and standardized integration for diagnostic criteria and measurement 
      methods/tools for slow gait speed in diagnosing MCR. The findings of this study 
      will be convenient for medical staff to examine the intended use and 
      applicability of each instrument/tool for evaluating the gait speed, and provide 
      insight into developing uniform guidelines for MCR. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - NUTRITIONAL RISK STATUS, DIETARY INTAKE AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OLDER ADULTS 
      WITH MOTORIC COGNITIVE RISK SYNDROME.
PG  - 47-54

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet are associated with 
      cognitive decline and dementia. Greater understanding of the nutritional intake 
      of older adults who are at increased risk for cognitive decline may allow for the 
      development of more effective dietary interventions to prevent or delay the onset 
      of dementia. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the 
      nutritional status, diet quality and individual nutritional components of older 
      adults with motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR). MCR is a pre-dementia syndrome 
      classified by slow gait speed and subjective memory impairments. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: A community-based senior center located in an 
      urban setting. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five community-dwelling older adults with MCR 
      aged 60-89 yrs. MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional risk status was determined using the 
      Nestle Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). A food frequency questionnaire was used 
      to quantify: overall dietary quality using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI); 
      adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) dietary 
      pattern; and intake of individual nutritional components shown to be protective 
      or harmful for cognitive function in older adults. Participants completed a 
      computerized cognitive testing battery to assess cognitive abilities. RESULTS: 
      More than one third (36%) of participants were at increased risk for 
      malnutrition. Participants at lower risk for malnutrition had better working 
      memory (r = 0.40, p = 0.04), executive functioning (r = 0.44, p = 0.03), and 
      overall cognition (r = 0.44, p = 0.03). While participants generally consumed a 
      reasonable quality diet (HEI = 65.15), 48% of participants had poor adherence to 
      a neuroprotective MIND dietary pattern. Higher intake of B-complex vitamins was 
      associated with better task switching (r = 0.40, p ≤ 0.05) and faster processing 
      speeds (r = 0.39, p ≤ 0.05). Higher vitamin C intake was associated with better 
      executive functioning (r = 0.40, p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that a significant proportion of older adults with MCR may be at increased risk 
      for malnutrition. While the diet quality of older adults with MCR appeared to 
      need improvement, future studies should investigate the effects of more specific 
      nutritional interventions, including the MIND diet, on cognition in at-risk older 
      adults.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize Cognitive Motor Dual Task (CMDT) 
      costs for a community-based sample of older adults with Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome (MCR), as well as investigate associations between CMDT costs and 
      cognitive performance. Twenty-five community-dwelling older adults (ages 60-89 
      years) with MCR performed single and dual task complex walking scenarios, as well 
      as a computerized cognitive testing battery. Participants with lower CMDT costs 
      had higher scores on composite measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and 
      Shifting, as well as an overall cognitive composite measure. In addition, 
      participants with faster single task gait velocity had higher scores on composite 
      measures of Working Memory, Processing Speed, and overall cognition. Taken 
      together, these results suggest that CMDT paradigms can help to elucidate the 
      interplay between cognitive and motor abilities for older adults with MCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia syndrome 
      characterized by subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait in the absence of 
      dementia and mobility disability. Worse cognitive and motoric function is 
      associated with chronic pain in older adults. Our aim was to study the 
      association between pain and prevalent and incident MCR in adults aged 65 years 
      and older. METHODS: We analyzed the cross-sectional association between severity 
      of pain and prevalent MCR in 3244 older adults participating in the Health and 
      Retirement Study (2008 wave) using logistic regression analysis adjusting for 
      demographic, peripheral, central or biological risk factors. Additionally, we 
      analyzed the longitudinal association between severity of pain and incident MCR 
      in 362 participants in the Central Control of Mobility in Aging Study, using Cox 
      regression analysis. RESULTS: The 155 Health and Retirement Study participants 
      with severe pain had an increased risk of prevalent MCR (n = 249), compared to 
      2245 individuals without pain (adjusted for demographics OR: 2.78, 95 % 
      CI:1.74-4.45). Over a mean follow-up of 3.01 years (SD 1.38), 29 individuals in 
      the Central Control of Mobility in Aging Study developed incident MCR. Older 
      adults with severe pain had over a five times increased risk of developing 
      incident MCR, compared to those without pain even after adjusting for demographic 
      variables (HR: 5.44, 95 % CI: 1.81-16.40). CONCLUSION: Older adults with severe 
      pain have a higher prevalence and incidence of MCR. These findings should be 
      further explored to establish if pain is a potentially modifiable risk factor to 
      prevent cognitive decline.

PG  - 1587-1599
LID - 10.1111/ene.15281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare risk factors, 
      neuroimaging characteristics and prognosis between two clinical prodromes of 
      dementia, namely, the motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) and mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI). METHODS: Between 2009 and 2015, dementia-free participants of 
      the population-based Rotterdam Study were classified with a dementia prodrome if 
      they had subjective cognitive complaints and scored &gt;1 SD below the population 
      mean of gait speed (MCRS) or &gt;1.5 SD below the population mean of cognitive 
      test scores (MCI). Using multinomial logistic regression models, we determined 
      cross-sectional associations of risk factors and structural neuroimaging markers 
      with MCRS and MCI, followed by subdistribution hazard models, to determine risk 
      of incident dementia until 2016. RESULTS: Of 3025 included participants (mean age 
      = 70.4 years, 54.7% women), 231 had MCRS (7.6%), 132 had MCI (4.4%), and 62 
      (2.0%) fulfilled criteria for both. Although many risk factors were shared, a 
      higher body mass index predisposed to MCRS, whereas male sex and 
      hypercholesterolemia were associated with MCI only. Gray matter volumes, 
      hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensities, and structural white matter 
      integrity were worse in both MCRS and MCI. During a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, 
      71 individuals developed dementia and 200 died. Five-year cumulative risk of 
      dementia was 7.0% (2.5%-11.5%) for individuals with MCRS, versus 13.3% 
      (5.8%-20.8%) with MCI and only 2.3% (1.5%-3.1%) in unaffected individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MCRS is associated with imaging markers of neurodegeneration and 
      risk of dementia, even in the absence of MCI, highlighting the potential of motor 
      function assessment in early risk stratification for dementia.

TI  - Motoric cognitive risk syndrome and the risk of incident dementia: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.
LID - 10.1159/000535082 [doi]
AB  - Background Epidemiologic studies have indicated an association of Motoric 
      Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia stage characterized by the presence 
      of cognitive complaints and a slow gait, with increased risk of incident 
      dementia. Objectives We aimed to clarify this association using meta-analysis. 
      Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science 
      databases up to December 2022 for relevant studies that investigated the 
      association between MCR and incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). The random effects model was used to determine a pooled-effect estimate of 
      the association. Results We identified seven articles that corresponded with nine 
      cohort studies investigating the association between MCR and the risk of 
      dementia. Pooled analysis showed that MCR was associated with a significantly 
      increased risk of incident all-cause dementia (HR=2.28; 95% CI: 1.90-2.73) and AD 
      (HR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.61-2.61). Sensitivity analysis showed that there was no 
      evidence that individual studies influenced the pooled-effect estimate, verifying 
      the robustness of the results. Conclusions Our results confirm that MCR is an 
      independent risk factor of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Future studies are 
      needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association.

AB  - Aim: We developed a home-based goal-directed exercise program with telephonic 
      coaching to overcome barriers to exercise participation in cognitively impaired 
      older adults. Methods: Six patients with Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome at high 
      risk for dementia were enrolled, three assigned to goal-directed exercises and 
      three to stretching exercises. All participants underwent an in-person training 
      session followed by a session at home with a telephonic coach. Sessions were 
      supervised by a physiatrist, and exercise programs were personalized. Results: 
      In-person training and remote telephonic coaching support promoted adherence. 
      There were no adverse effects and interventions were rated highly. Participant 
      and logistical barriers were identified that can inform design of home-based 
      clinical trials. Conclusion: Home-based exercises are safe and feasible in older 
      adults with Motoric Cognitive Risk.

OAB - Lay abstract Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome is characterized by presence of 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait. Patients who are diagnosed with this syndrome 
      are at high risk for developing dementia. Hence, it is important to develop safe 
      and effective exercise programs to prevent cognitive decline in these patients. 
      Our study shows that home-based exercises with telephonic coaching are both safe 
      as well as feasible in patients with Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome. 
      Participants reported high satisfaction with the exercise intervention, and 
      strong interest in participating in future studies. They found the individualized 
      exercise program to be appropriate to their own level of fitness, and this 
      provided them confidence to continue exercising at home.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine polygenic inheritance of motoric cognitive risk syndrome 
      (MCR), a predementia syndrome characterized by the presence of subjective 
      cognitive complaints and slow gait. METHODS: We analyzed 4,915 individuals, age 
      65 years and above, with European ancestry (mean age 75.0 ± 6.8 years, 56.6% 
      women) in the Health and Retirement Study. Polygenic scores (PGS) were calculated 
      as weighted sums of the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms, with effect 
      sizes derived from genome-wide association studies. The association between PGSs 
      of 9 phenotypes (general cognition, body mass index [BMI], mean arterial 
      pressure, education, Alzheimer disease [AD], neuroticism, well-being, waist 
      circumference, and depressive symptoms) and MCR as well as its key components 
      (cognitive complaints and slow gait) were examined by logistic regression, 
      adjusting for age, sex, education, and genetic ancestry, and reported as odds 
      ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There were 260 
      prevalent MCR cases, 529 with slow gait, and 1,928 with subjective cognitive 
      complaints. Higher PGSs for BMI (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39) and waist 
      circumference (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.40) were associated with MCR, and PGS of AD 
      showed a suggestive association (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32). Higher PGS for 
      neuroticism (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18) was associated with cognitive complaints, 
      whereas higher well-being PGS (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) was protective. PGS for 
      BMI (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.28), waist circumference (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31), 
      and AD (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24) was associated with slow gait. CONCLUSION: 
      Obesity-related genetic traits increase risk of MCR syndrome; further 
      investigation is required to identify potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is characterized by 
      subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) and slow gait (SG). Metabolomics and 
      lipidomics may potentiate disclosure of the underlying mechanisms of MCR. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study from the West China Health and Aging 
      Trend cohort study (WCHAT). The operational definition of MCR is the presence of 
      SCCs and SG without dementia or mobility disability. The test and analysis were 
      based on untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics, consensus clustering, lasso 
      regression and 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: This study enrolled 6,031 
      individuals for clinical analysis and 577 plasma samples for omics analysis. The 
      overall prevalence of MCR was 9.7%, and the prevalence of MCR-only, assessed 
      cognitive impairment-only (CI-only) and MCR-CI were 7.5, 13.3, and 2.1%, 
      respectively. By consensus clustering analysis, MCR-only was clustered into three 
      metabolic subtypes, MCR-I, MCR-II and MCR-III. Clinically, body fat mass (OR = 
      0.89, CI = 0.82-0.96) was negatively correlated with MCR-I, and comorbidity (OR = 
      2.19, CI = 1.10-4.38) was positively correlated with MCR-III. Diabetes mellitus 
      had the highest ORs above 1 in MCR-II and MCR-III (OR = 3.18, CI = 1.02-9.91; OR 
      = 2.83, CI = 1.33-6.04, respectively). The risk metabolites of MCR-III showed 
      relatively high similarity with those of cognitive impairment. Notably, 
      L-proline, L-cystine, ADMA, and N1-acetylspermidine were significantly changed in 
      MCR-only, and PC(40:3), SM(32:1), TG(51:3), eicosanoic acid(20:1), 
      methyl-D-galactoside and TG(50:3) contributed most to the prediction model for 
      MCR-III. INTERPRETATION: Pre-dementia syndrome of MCR has distinct metabolic 
      subtypes, and SCCs and SG may cause different metabolic changes to develop MCR.

LID - 10.1111/ene.14266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recently proposed pre-dementia syndrome, motoric 
      cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, is characterized by cognitive complaints and slow 
      gait, and increases the risk of dementia and mortality. The aim of the present 
      study was to explore the prevalence of and factors associated with MCR syndrome 
      in elderly community-dwelling Chinese subjects. METHODS: The Ningbo Community 
      Study on Aging recruited 953 Chinese community-dwelling participants 
      aged ≥ 65 years from November 2016 to March 2017. Handgrip, 
      Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand (FTSS) test time and body composition, as well as 
      comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were measured as potentially independent 
      factors associated with MCR syndrome. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR syndrome was 
      12.8% in men and 12.6% in women, and high prevalence of MCR syndrome was not 
      associated with age or sex. Multiple logistic regression analysis by sex showed 
      that a 1-SD increase in FTSS test time in males and females was associated with 
      45% (95% confidence intervals, 19-76; P < 0.01) and 20% (95% confidence 
      intervals, 9-33; P < 0.01) higher risk of having MCR syndrome, respectively, 
      whereas handgrip strength was inversely correlated with MCR syndrome in males 
      [odds ratio (OR), 0.91; P = 0.02] but not females (P = 0.06). Moreover, the 
      relationship of arm fat mass and MCR syndrome was statistically significant in 
      both sexes (OR, 1.69-1.77), but leg fat mass was only associated with MCR 
      syndrome (OR, 1.56; P = 0.02) in men. CONCLUSIONS: Handgrip, FTSS test time and 
      body composition were associated in a sex-specific manner with MCR syndrome in 
      elderly community-dwelling Chinese subjects. Our results on MCR syndrome are 
      novel and should be considered as important information in future studies.

TI  - Physical and cognitive profiles in motoric cognitive risk syndrome in an older 
      population from Southern Italy.
PG  - 2565-2573
LID - 10.1111/ene.14882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In older age, physical and cognitive declines have been 
      shown to occur simultaneously or consequent to one another, and several 
      operational definitions have been proposed to consider the co-presence of the two 
      declines; for example, "Motoric cognitive risk syndrome" (MCR) has been proposed 
      as a definition for the coexistence of slow gait plus subjective cognitive 
      complaints. Given the increasing interest in MCR and its potential role as both 
      biomarker and therapeutic target, we aimed to estimate its prevalence in a large 
      cohort of non-demented older subjects, and to examine the associations between 
      physical status, global cognitive dysfunction, and impairment in various 
      cognitive domains in MCR. METHODS: A population-based sample of 1041 older people 
      in Southern Italy (mean age 75.15 years) was enrolled. We defined MCR using 
      slowness and a single question for subjective cognitive complaints. We also 
      administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, together with tests 
      assessing physical function. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR was 9.9% (95% 
      confidence interval 8.2-11.9). MCR was associated with decreased processing speed 
      and executive function after adjusting for all relevant confounders. However, we 
      found no significant association of MCR with decreased global cognition and 
      immediate/delayed free recall of verbal memory. MCR was also associated with 
      increased exhaustion, low muscle strength, and low physical activity, and 
      increased levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present findings on MCR prevalence and associated cognitive and physical domains 
      and inflammatory biomarkers may help to uncover altered pathways and therapeutic 
      targets for intervention during the long preclinical phase of neurodegenerative 
      dementia.

TI  - Motoric cognitive risk syndrome and incident dementia in older adults from the 
      Québec NuAge cohort.
PG  - 969-973
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afaa235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-occurrence of slow walking speed and subjective cognitive 
      complaint (SCC) in non-demented individuals defines motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR), which is a pre-dementia stage. There is no information on the 
      association between MCR and incident dementia in Québec's older population. 
      OBJECTIVE: The study aims to examine the association of MCR and its individual 
      components (i.e. SCC and slow walking speed) with incident dementia in 
      community-dwelling older adults living in the province of Québec (Canada). 
      DESIGN: Québec older people population-based observational cohort study with 
      3 years of follow-up. SETTING: Community dwellings. SUBJECTS: A subset of 
      participants (n = 1,098) in 'Nutrition as a determinant of successful aging: The 
      Québec longitudinal study' (NuAge). METHODS: At baseline, participants with MCR 
      were identified. Incident dementia was measured at annual follow-up visits using 
      the Modified Mini-Mental State (≤79/100) test and Instrumental Activity Daily 
      Living scale (≤6/8) score values. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCR was 4.2% at 
      baseline and the overall incidence of dementia was 3.6%. MCR (Hazard Ratio 
      (HR) = 5.18, with 95% confidence interval (CI) = [2.43-11.03] and P ≤ 0.001) and 
      SCC alone (HR = 2.54, with 95% CI = [1.33-4.85] and P = 0.005) were associated 
      with incident dementia, but slow walking speed was not (HR = 0.81, with 
      95%CI = [0.25-2.63] and P = 0.736). CONCLUSIONS: MCR and SCC are associated with 
      incident dementia in NuAge study participants.

TI  - Prevalence of Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome Among Community-Dwelling Older 
      Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 16-24
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20240312-01 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To systematically review the prevalence of motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR) among community-dwelling older adults and provide evidence-based 
      support for policymakers planning health and social care policies. METHOD: Web of 
      Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for 
      cross-sectional, prospective cohort, or population-based longitudinal studies of 
      community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years with MCR from inception of the 
      database through December 18, 2021. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. 
      Pooled prevalence of MCR was found to be 10% (95% confidence interval [8%, 12%], 
      I(2) = 98.4%). Results of a subgroup analysis revealed a combined prevalence of 
      MCR of 8.2% in males and 9.2% in females. Pooled prevalence of MCR was 9.7% in 
      Asia and 10.2% in other regions. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of MCR in 
      community-dwelling older adults is high. Our research may improve the 
      epidemiological understanding of MCR, draw attention to older adults with MCR, 
      and thus promote research of MCR and the formulation of relevant public health 
      policies. With early identification and intervention of MCR, cognitive function 
      can be improved, and the onset of dementia can be delayed or prevented. [Journal 
      of Gerontological Nursing, 50(4), 16-24.].

TI  - Association between motoric cognitive risk syndrome and future falls among

PG  - e3044
LID - 10.1002/brb3.3044 [doi]
LID - e3044
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), known as the predementia 
      stage, is characterized by both subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) and slow 
      gait. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between MCR, its 
      components, and falls. METHODS: Participants aged ≥ 60 years were selected from 
      China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. SCC was determined by 
      participants' responses to the question "How would you rate your memory at 
      present?" with "poor" being the indicative answer. Slow gait was defined as one 
      standard deviation or more below age- and gender-appropriate mean values of gait 
      speed. MCR was identified when both SCC and slow gait were presented. Future 
      falls were investigated by the question "have you fallen down during follow-up 
      until wave 4 in 2018?" Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the 
      longitudinal association of MCR, its components and future falls during the 
      following 3 years. RESULTS: Of 3748 samples in this study, the prevalence of MCR, 
      SCC, and slow gait was 5.92%, 33.06%, and 15.21%, respectively. MCR increased the 
      risk of falls during the following 3 years by 66.7% compared to non-MCR after 
      controlling for covariates. In the fully adjusted models, with the healthy group 
      as reference, MCR (OR = 1.519, 95%CI = 1.086-2.126) and SCC (OR = 1.241, 
      95%CI = 1.018-1.513), but not slow gait, increased the risk of future falls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MCR independently predicts future falls risk in the following 3 
      years. Measuring MCR can be a pragmatic tool for early identification of falls 
      risk.

TI  - The Association Between Subjective Age and Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome: 
      Results From a Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 2023-2028
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbab047 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, characterized by cognitive 
      complaints and slower gait speed, is a predementia syndrome associated with 
      dementia and mortality risk. The present study examined whether subjective age, 
      that is, how old or young individuals feel relative to their chronological age, 
      is related to concurrent and incident MCR syndrome. A relation between subjective 
      age and MCR will inform knowledge on psychological factors related to dementia 
      risk, identify who is at greater risk, and suggest a potential target of 
      intervention. METHODS: The study sample was composed of 6,341 individuals aged 
      65-107 years without dementia from the Health and Retirement Study, a 
      longitudinal study of adults aged 50 years and older. Participants completed 
      measures of subjective age, cognitive complaints, and gait speed and provided 
      information on demographic factors, cognition, physical activity, depressive 
      symptoms, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline in 2008/2010. Incident MCR was 
      assessed 4 and 8 years later. RESULTS: Controlling for demographic factors, an 
      older subjective age was related to more than 60% higher likelihood of MCR at 
      baseline and to around 50% higher risk of incident MCR over time. These 
      associations remained significant when cognition, physical inactivity, depressive 
      symptoms, and BMI were included in the analytic models. DISCUSSION: This study 
      provides evidence that how old individuals feel is related to concurrent and 
      incident MCR beyond the effect of chronological age, other demographic factors, 
      physical inactivity, depressive symptoms, BMI, and cognitive functioning.

TI  - Association between sleep disturbance with motoric cognitive risk syndrome in 
      Chinese older adults.
PG  - 1470-1478
LID - 10.1111/ene.14681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment are common and 
      related in the elderly population worldwide. The aim of the present study was to 
      explore the association between sleep disturbance and motoric cognitive risk 
      (MCR) syndrome, which is characterized by subjective cognitive complaints and 
      objective slow gait in older individuals without dementia or any mobility 
      disability in the community-dwelling elderly Chinese population. METHODS: We 
      recruited 940 participants aged ≥65 years from November 2016 to March 2017 in the 
      Ningbo Community Study on Aging (NCSA). Self-reported sleep duration and 
      sleep-quality variables, comprehensive geriatric evaluation, as well as 
      indicators for diagnosing MCR syndrome were evaluated in this cross-sectional 
      study. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a 1-SD increase 
      in night (1.1 h) and 24-h sleep duration (1.3 h) was associated, respectively, 
      with a 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-47%; p = 0.04) and 30% (95% CI, 
      3%-64%; p = 0.03) higher odds of having MCR syndrome. Considering sleep duration 
      as a categorical variable, longer night-sleep duration (>8.5 h) was associated 
      with MCR syndrome (OR, 2.03; p = 0.02) compared to shorter night-sleep duration 
      (<8 h). For sleep-quality factors, increasing frequency of trouble falling 
      asleep, waking early or easily, nightmares, and taking sleep drugs were 
      significantly associated with MCR syndrome after adjusting for potential 
      covariables (all p for trend < 0.05), but not for self-perceived sleep quality (p 
      for trend = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Long sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and 
      taking sleep drugs were associated with higher odds of having MCR syndrome in the 
      community-dwelling elderly Chinese population. Further research is needed to 
      explore the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Slow gait has been shown to be a good predictor of declining 
      cognitive function in healthy older adults. Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome 
      is a new construct incorporating slow gait and subjective cognitive complaints in 
      individuals without dementia who have preserved activities of daily living. This 
      analysis investigated the prevalence of MCR and factors associated with MCR in a 
      nationally representative population. In addition, cross-sectional associations 
      between MCR and cognitive domains, an relationship yet to be fully elucidated in 
      literature, was investigated. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and gait analysis at a health 
      assessment center. Logistic regression was employed to examine associated health 
      factors. Composite scores reflecting global cognition, memory, sustained 
      attention, executive function, and processing speed were constructed using 
      neuropsychological test scores. Associations between MCR and these composites 
      were quantified using multivariate generalized linear modelling. All analyses 
      were weighted to be nationally representative. SETTING: Community-dwelling adults 
      in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) completed an interview and a 
      center-based health assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged 60 years and over 
      (n = 2151, age; mean: 67.84 years, range: 60-93) were included. Participants with 
      a Mini-Mental State Examination score of below 24, a diagnosis of serious memory 
      impairment, Parkinson disease, dementia, or Alzheimer disease were excluded. 
      RESULTS: MCR prevalence was estimated at 2.56% (95% confidence interval 1.97, 
      3.31). Significant risk factors for MCR were antidepressant use [odds ratio (OR) 
      4.46, P < .001], self-reported poor vision (OR 4.92, P < .05), and obesity (OR 
      2.29, P < .01). Individuals with MCR performed worse on tests that assess memory 
      (B: -0.58, P < .001), global cognition (B: -0.42, P < .001), and sustained 
      attention (B: -0.34, P < .05) with robust adjustment made for confounding 
      demographic and health variables. CONCLUSIONS: MCR is characterized by strong 
      negative associations with global cognition, attention, and memory. This may be 
      indicative of the underlying pathology of MCR. The effect of antidepressant use 
      on MCR is novel and may represent an important consideration in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy is related to motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is 
      not fully understood. Therefore, our aim was to fill this gap in knowledge. 
      METHODS: This population-based prospective longitudinal study used data from the 
      China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. It included 3827 dementia-free 
      older adults (age >60 years) who were followed from 2011 to 2015. Data on 
      subjective cognitive complaints, walking speed, and polypharmacy were reported by 
      the participants. The cross-sectional relationship between polypharmacy and the 
      MCR at baseline was examined using multinomial logistic regression, and Cox 
      regression will be used to analyze the impact of polypharmacy on MCR over a 
      four-year period. RESULTS: At baseline, 492 (12.9%) participants had been 
      diagnosed with MCR. With 4 years of follow-up, 304 (12.5%) were classified as 
      having incident MCR. Controlling for microsystem factors, polypharmacy (OR: 
      1.273, 95 % CI: 1.051-1.541; p < .05) was associated with MCR at baseline and 
      every unit increase in polypharmacy was linked to a 53.8% (HR:1.538, 95 % CI: 
      1.227-1.927; p < .001) increase more likely to developing incident MCR. They 
      adjusted for meso/ exosystem and macrosystem factors, and these associations 
      remained significant, coping resources are believed to have a role in the 
      relationships between polypharmacy and MCR in older persons. CONCLUSION: 
      Polypharmacy is significantly associated with MCR incidence during 4 years of 
      follow-up in older adults. Future studies should independently confirm this 
      observation for potentially bringing clinical benefits to older people with 
      polypharmacy.

TI  - Association between depression and motoric cognitive risk syndrome among 
      community-dwelling older adults in China: A 4-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1377-1384

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Depression can lead to a wide range of adverse health 
      outcomes, including dementia. However, evidence supporting the relationship 
      between depression and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia 
      syndrome, remains lacking. This study aimed to examine the association between 
      depression and MCR among community-dwelling Chinese older adults. METHODS: Data 
      were taken from the 2011 and 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement 
      Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Depression was defined by a Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score ≥10. MCR was defined as 
      subjective cognitive complaints and objective slow gait speed. Multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal associations between depression and MCR at baseline and a 4-year 
      follow-up period for the sample population and gender groups. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of MCR was higher in participants with depression than in those 
      without depression at baseline (12.2% vs. 8.9%; p = 0.001). Participants with 
      depression at baseline had a higher 4-year incidence of MCR than those without 
      depression (14.8% vs. 8.7%; p < 0.001). Both cross-sectional analysis (odds ratio 
      [OR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.75) and prospective analysis 
      (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.56-2.44) demonstrated that depression was significantly 
      associated with MCR. These associations were consistent across different gender 
      groups and stronger among female individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Depression is an 
      independent risk factor for MCR among community-dwelling Chinese older adults. 
      Special attention should be paid to the care of older people with depression to 
      reduce the occurrence of MCR and even dementia.

TI  - Motoric cognitive risk syndrome and incident dementia: results from a 
      population-based prospective and observational cohort study.
PG  - 468-474
LID - 10.1111/ene.14093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), which is the 
      juncture of subjective cognitive complaint and slow gait speed, is a pre-dementia 
      stage. The aims of the study are (i) to compare characteristics between 
      individuals who have MCR defined using slow walking speed and/or increased 
      five-times-sit-to-stand (FTSS) time as its motor component(s); and (ii) to 
      characterize the association of MCR and its various motor components with 
      incident dementia including Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer dementia in the 
      participants of the Epidémiologie de l'Ostéoporose (EPIDOS) study. METHODS: This 
      prospective and observational cohort study selected 651 participants recruited 
      from the EPIDOS study in Toulouse (France). MCR was defined as the association of 
      subjective cognitive complaint and slow gait speed and/or increased FTSS time in 
      participants without either dementia and mobility disabilities at baseline. 
      Individuals with dementia were prospectively diagnosed during the physical and 
      neuropsychological assessments included in the 7-year follow-up. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of MCR was around 7% when using an exclusive motor criterion, either 
      slow gait speed or increased FTSS time, and was 20.9% when MCR subgroups were 
      pooled. MCR was positively associated with incident dementia regardless of its 
      type, and with Alzheimer disease in the slow gait speed MCR subgroup [odds ratio 
      (OR) > 2.18 with P ≤ 0.037] but not with non-Alzheimer dementia. No significant 
      association between incident dementia and MCR defined using increased FTSS time 
      was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that MCR is associated with incident 
      dementia and that slow gait speed is the appropriate motor criterion for 
      detecting dementia risk.

TI  - Association of multimorbidity patterns with motoric cognitive risk syndrome among 
      older adults: Evidence from a China longitudinal study.
PG  - e6021
LID - 10.1002/gps.6021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia syndrome, is 
      characterized by slow gait and subjective cognitive complaints among older 
      adults. This study assessed the relationship between multimorbidity, its 
      patterns, and MCR. METHODS: Data for this study were obtained from three waves 
      (2011, 2013, and 2015) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. 
      Participants who were aged 60 years and older and had complete data at baseline 
      as well as complete data about MCR at follow-up were selected. Patients without 
      MCR at baseline were selected for further analyses. Longitudinal associations 
      between multimorbidity, its patterns, and MCR were examined using a Cox 
      proportional hazards model. Multimorbidity patterns were classified using latent 
      class analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4923 respondents were included at baseline, 
      43.47% of whom had multimorbidity. Additionally, the prevalence of MCR at 
      baseline was 12.61%. After adjusting for covariates, multimorbidity was 
      positively associated with MCR (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.33, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = 1.06-1.68). A higher number of multimorbidity was also significantly 
      associated with an increased risk of developing MCR (HR = 1.10, 95% 
      CI = 1.02-1.19). Three multimorbidity patterns were selected: relatively healthy 
      pattern, respiratory pattern, and cardiovascular pattern. Older adults with the 
      cardiovascular pattern were 1.57 times more likely to develop MCR than those with 
      the relatively healthy pattern (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.16-2.13). There was no 
      significant difference between the relatively healthy pattern and the respiratory 
      pattern (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.91-1.92). CONCLUSIONS: MCR is highly prevalent 
      among older Chinese adults. MCR may be exacerbated by multimorbidity. For older 
      adults with multimorbidity (especially cardiovascular multimorbidity), attention 
      should be paid to MCR to achieve early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study to explore the biological substrate of 
      the Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome in a Memory Clinic cohort, using a 
      multimodal imaging approach. Twenty participants were recruited and classified as 
      MCR+/-. Amyloid- and tau-PET uptakes, temporal atrophy, white matter 
      hyperintensities, lateral ventricular volume (LVV), and diffusion tensor 
      parameters were compared between groups. No significant differences were found in 
      imaging features related to Alzheimer's disease or gross vascular damage. MCR+ 
      patients had increased LVV and altered diffusion parameters in the superior 
      corona radiata. Ventricular enlargement and microstructural damage of the 
      surrounding white matter tracts could contribute to MCR pathophysiology.

TI  - Cortical Thickness, Volume, and Surface Area in the Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome.
PG  - 651-665
LID - 10.3233/JAD-201576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a pre-clinical stage of 
      dementia characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaint. Yet, the brain 
      substrates of MCR are not well established. OBJECTIVE: To examine cortical 
      thickness, volume, and surface area associated with MCR in the MCR-Neuroimaging 
      Consortium, which harmonizes image processing/analysis of multiple cohorts. 
      METHODS: Two-hundred MRIs (M age 72.62 years; 47.74%female; 33.17%MCR) from four 
      different cohorts (50 each) were first processed with FreeSurfer 6.0, and then 
      analyzed using multivariate and univariate general linear models with 1,000 
      bootstrapped samples (n-1; with resampling). All models adjusted for age, sex, 
      education, white matter lesions, total intracranial volume, and study site. 
      RESULTS: Overall, cortical thickness was lower in individuals with MCR than in 
      those without MCR. There was a trend in the same direction for cortical volume 
      (p = 0.051). Regional cortical thickness was also lower among individuals with 
      MCR than individuals without MCR in prefrontal, insular, temporal, and parietal 
      regions. CONCLUSION: Cortical atrophy in MCR is pervasive, and include regions 
      previously associated with human locomotion, but also social, cognitive, 
      affective, and motor functions. Cortical atrophy in MCR is easier to detect in 
      cortical thickness than volume and surface area because thickness is more 
      affected by healthy and pathological aging.

TI  - Association between positive control in self-perceptions of aging and motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome among Chinese community-dwelling older adults: a 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-perceptions of aging (SPA) are important psychosocial factors 
      that lead to a wide range of outcomes including dementia. However, the 
      relationships between positive SPA and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) 
      which is a predementia syndrome are still unknown. This study aimed to reveal the 
      associations of positive control and aging awareness of SPA with the risk of MCR 
      and its components. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was conducted among 1137 
      Chinese community-dwelling older adults. Positive control and aging awareness 
      were defined by two dimensions of SPA (Positive control and Timeline chronic). 
      MCR was determined according to definition. Multivariable logistic regression was 
      used to examine the associations. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MCR was 
      11.5% (mean age = 71.62 ± 5.22). After adjusting for depression, anxiety, and 
      cognitive function, positive control was associated with reduced risk of MCR 
      (OR = 0.624, 95% CI 0.402-0.969, P = 0.036), subjective cognitive complaints 
      (SCC) (OR = 0.687, 95% CI 0.492-0.959, P = 0.027), and gait speed (GS) 
      (OR = 0.377, 95% CI 0.197-0.720, P = 0.003), respectively. Aging awareness was 
      merely related to increased risk of MCR (OR = 1.386, 95% CI 1.062-1.810, 
      P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the crucial associations of 
      positive control and aging awareness with MCR and its components. Our results 
      emphasize that positive belief in control and adaptive aging awareness might be 
      promising targets for preventing MCR.

AB  - Background: Late-life depressive symptomatology and motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR) have independently been associated with an increased risk for 
      incident dementia. This study aimed to examine the association of late-life 
      depressive symptomatology, MCR, and their combination on incident dementia in 
      community-dwelling older adults living in Quebec (Canada). Methods: The study was 
      carried out in a subset of 1,098 community dwellers aged ≥65 years recruited in 
      the "Nutrition as a determinant of successful aging: The Quebec longitudinal 
      study" (NuAge), an observational prospective cohort study with 3 years follow-up. 
      At baseline, MCR was defined by the association of subjective cognitive complaint 
      with slow walking speed, and late-life depressive symptomatology with a 30-item 
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score >5/30. Incident dementia, defined as a 
      Modified Mini-Mental State score ≤79/100 test and Instrumental Activity Daily 
      Living score <4/4, was assessed at each annual visit. Results: The prevalence of 
      late-life depressive symptomatology only was 31.1%, of MCR only 1.8%, and the 
      combination of late-life depressive symptomatology and MCR 2.4%. The combination 
      of late-life depressive symptomatology and MCR at baseline was associated with 
      significant overall incident dementia (odds ratio (OR) = 2.31 with P ≤ 0.001) but 
      not for MCR only (OR = 3.75 with P = 0.186) or late-life depressive 
      symptomatology only (OR = 1.29 with P = 0.276). Conclusions: The combination of 
      late-life depressive symptomatology and MCR is associated with incident dementia 
      in older community dwellers. The results suggested an interplay between late-life 
      depressive symptomatology and MCR exposing them to an increased risk for 
      dementia.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome and Risk for Falls, Their Recurrence, and 
      Postfall Fractures: Results From a Prospective Observational Population-Based 
      Cohort Study.
PG  - 1268-1273

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia stage 
      associated with increased risk for falls. There are conflicting results regarding 
      its association with recurrent falls and no information about its association 
      with postfall fractures. The aim of the study was to examine the association of 
      MCR and its components [ie, slow walking speed and subjective cognitive complaint 
      (SCC)] with the occurrence of falls, their recurrence, and postfall fractures in 
      older community-dwelling adults. DESIGN: Observational prospective and 
      longitudinal cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: French community-dwelling 
      older women (n = 5958) recruited in the EPIDémiologie de l'OStéoporose (EPIDOS) 
      study. MEASURES: MCR was defined as both the presence of SCC and slow walking 
      speed in women free of major neurocognitive disorders. Falls (≥1), recurrent 
      falls (≥2), and postfall fractures (any fractures and hip fractures) were 
      prospectively recorded using mail and/or phone call questionnaires every 4 months 
      over 4 years. RESULTS: At baseline, the prevalence of SCC was 43.1% (n = 2569), 
      slow walking speed 5.7% (n = 341), and MCR 9.9% (n = 591). Overall, 25.7% 
      (n = 1533) of participants reported any fall during the follow-up. The incidence 
      of postfall hip fractures was higher in participants with MCR compared to healthy 
      participants and those with SCC (P ≤ .001). Cox regression models revealed that 
      only participants with MCR had a significantly high risk for falls [hazard ratio 
      (HR) = 1.22, P = .021], recurrent falls (HR = 1.46 with P = .030), and postfall 
      hip fractures (HR = 2.54, P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: There is an 
      increased risk for falls, their recurrence, and postfall hip fractures associated 
      with MCR but not with its individual components. This finding underscores the 
      clinical interest of MCR for the detection of older adults at risk for falls and 
      their related adverse events in order to start early appropriate interventions 
      for fall reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia syndrome. The 
      aim of this study was to examine whether there is: 1) an association between MCR 
      and cardiovascular diseases and risk factors (CVDRF) in the Canadian population, 
      and 2) a specific MCR-related CVDRF profile (i.e., cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 
      versus cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) versus both) when comparing different 
      age groups. METHODS: A total of 29,569 participants free of dementia were 
      recruited in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Participants were 
      categorized into groups by their age and MCR status (with MCR versus without 
      MCR). Overweight/obese, smoking, waist to hip circumference ratio (WHCR), 
      systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure levels were CVRF. Diabetes 
      type I and II, hypertension, heart disease and attack, peripheral vascular 
      disease, angina, stroke and rhythmic disease were CVD. RESULTS: A higher 
      prevalence of CVRF in MCR was shown in the youngest age groups (i.e., 45-54 and 
      55-64) compared to the other age groups. MCR was positively associated with 
      CVDRF, except in the oldest age group (i.e., ≥75). In this group, the only 
      significant association with CVRF was with diastolic blood pressure, which was 
      negatively associated with MCR. Diabetes and hypertension were not associated 
      with MCR. CONCLUSIONS: MCR is associated with CVDRF in both younger and older 
      individuals. A stronger association was present for CVRF factors in younger 
      adults and for CVD in older adults.

TI  - Association of Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome With Brain Volumes: Results From 
      the GAIT Study.
PG  - 1081-8
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glw012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "motoric cognitive risk" (MCR) syndrome is a newly reported 
      predementia syndrome combining cognitive complaint and slow gait speed. We 
      hypothesized that individuals with MCR syndrome would have lower brain volumes 
      compared with non-MCR individuals. This study aims (i) to compare the cognitive 
      profile of nondemented older community-dwellers with and without MCR syndrome and 
      (ii) to examine association of global and regional brain volumes with MCR 
      syndrome. METHODS: A total of 171 individuals (28 MCR and 143 non-MCR) were 
      included in this cross-sectional study. Total white matter abnormalities, total 
      white matter, total cortical and subcortical gray matters, hippocampus, motor 
      cortex, premotor cortex, and prefrontal cortex were examined. Brain volumes were 
      quantified from a three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging using 
      semi-automated software. Age, gender, education level, number of drugs taken 
      daily, use of psychoactive drugs, and cognitive profile were also measured. 
      RESULTS: The distribution of cognitively healthy individuals and those with mild 
      cognitive impairment was not different in participants with and without MCR. 
      Multiple logistic regression models showed that smaller volumes of total gray 
      matter (p = .016), total cortical gray matter (p = .010), premotor cortex (p = 
      .018), prefrontal cortex (p = .026), and dorsolateral segment of prefrontal 
      cortex (p = .032) were associated with MCR status. The premotor cortex presented 
      the highest mean difference for brain regional volume between MCR and non-MCR 
      participants (p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed similar cognitive 
      profile in MCR and non-MCR participants, and MCR-related smaller global and 
      regional gray matter volumes involving premotor and prefrontal cortices, 
      suggesting that the MCR syndrome may predict cortical neurodegenerative dementia 
      more than subcortical dementia.

TI  - Do cognitive performance and physical function differ between individuals with 
      motoric cognitive risk syndrome and those with mild cognitive impairment?
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s12877-020-01992-z [doi]
LID - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is defined by slow gait speed 
      combined with subjective cognitive complaint. MCR is a predementia syndrome, 
      similar to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there is currently no study 
      comparing the differences in cognitive performance and physical function between 
      these two types of cognitive impairment. Thus, the aim of this study is to 
      compare cognitive performance and physical function in individuals with MCR 
      versus MCI. METHODS: A total of 77 participants, free of dementia, were recruited 
      from the neurological outpatient clinic of a medical center in Taiwan. 
      Participants were separated into 2 groups, MCR (n = 33) and MCI (n = 44) groups, 
      based on definition criteria from previous studies. The priority was to assign a 
      diagnosis of MCR first, followed by MCI. Hence, "pure" MCI had no overlap with 
      MCR syndrome. Cognitive performance, including executive function, attention, 
      working memory, episode memory, visuospatial function, and language, were 
      measured. Physical functions such as activities in daily living, the Tinetti 
      Assessment Scale, and the Timed Up and Go test were also measured. RESULTS: 
      Executive function, attention, working memory, episodic memory and language were 
      all significantly lower in the MCR group than the MCI group. Abilities related to 
      physical function, including those measured by the Tinetti Assessment Scale and 
      the Timed Up and Go test, were significantly lower in the MCR group than the MCI 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: We noted that cognitive performance and physical function 
      were lower in MCR individuals than MCI but without MCR syndrome. However, the 
      conclusions were based on the enrollment procedure of participants prioritizes 
      the MCR syndrome. Because of the overlap of MCR and MCI, future studies should 
      use different enrollment strategies to further clarify the status of these two 
      populations.

TI  - Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome Using Three-Item Recall Test and Its Associations 
      with Fall-Related Outcomes: The Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17103364 [doi]
LID - 3364
AB  - Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is originally defined as the presence of 
      subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) and slow gait (SG). MCR is well known to 
      be useful for predicting adverse health outcomes, including falls and dementia. 
      However, around four out of five older Korean adults reported SCCs, thereby, it 
      may not be discriminative to define MCR in Korea. We adopted the three-item 
      recall (3IR) test, instead of SCCs, to define MCR. This cross-sectional analysis 
      included 2133 community-dwelling older adults aged 70-84 years, without dementia 
      or any dependence in activities of daily living from the Korean Frailty and Aging 
      Cohort Study. The newly attempted criteria of MCR using 3IR were met by 105 
      participants (4.9%). MCR using 3IR showed synergistic effects on fall-related 
      outcomes, whereas the conventional definition of MCR using SCCs was not superior 
      to SG only. MCR using 3IR was associated with falls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.92; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 1.16-3.16), recurrent falls (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 
      1.12-4.32), falls with injury (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.22-3.22), falls with fracture 
      (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.09-5.79), fear of falling (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.83-4.92), and 
      low activities-specific balance confidence (OR: 3.13; 95% CI: 1.57-6.25). We 
      found that MCR using 3IR could be useful in predicting fall-related outcomes in a 
      cultural background reporting more SCCs, such as Korea.

TI  - Social frailty and the incidence of motoric cognitive risk syndrome in older 
      adults.
LID - 10.1002/alz.13696 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various associations between social factors and motoric cognitive 
      risk syndrome (MCR) have been reported. However, whether social frailty 
      (integrated from multiple social factors) is associated with MCR is still 
      unclear. METHODS: We included 4657 individuals without MCR at Round 1 of the 
      NHATS as the discovery sample, and 3075 newly recruited individuals from Round 5 
      of the NHATS as the independent validation sample. Social frailty was assessed by 
      five social items. MCR was defined as the presence of both subjective cognitive 
      complaints and slow gait speed in individuals without dementia or mobility 
      disability. RESULTS: Compared with normal individuals, those with social frailty 
      had higher risk of incident MCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.57, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.34-1.84). Each additional unfavorable social item was associated with an 
      increased risk of MCR (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.22-1.43). DISCUSSION: Social frailty 
      was associated with an increased risk of incident MCR in older adults. 
      HIGHLIGHTS: Various associations between social factors and motoric cognitive 
      risk syndrome (MCR) have been reported. Social frailty that integrated from 
      multiple social factors was associated with an increased risk of incident MCR. 
      Social frailty should be included in the early screening of individuals to 
      identify those at higher risk of MCR.

TI  - Walking While Talking and Prefrontal Oxygenation in Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome: Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects.
PG  - 1585-1596
LID - 10.3233/JAD-210239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) combines slow gait and 
      cognitive complaints and has been proposed as a predementia syndrome. The nature 
      of dual-task performance in MCR has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To assess 
      differences in dual-task performance between participants with and without MCR 
      and to study the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-based brain activity during dual-task 
      using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS: Cohort study of 
      community-dwelling non-demented older adults included in the "Central Control of 
      Mobility in Aging" study. Comprehensive assessment included global cognition and 
      executive function tests along with clinical variables. Dual-task paradigm 
      consisted in walking while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet (WWT) on an 
      electronic walkway. We compared dual-task performance between MCR (n = 60) and No 
      MCR (n = 478) participants and assessed the relationship of dual-task performance 
      with cognitive function. In a subsample, we compared PFC oxygenation during WWT 
      between MCR (n = 32) and No MCR (n = 293). RESULTS: In our sample of 538 
      high-functioning older adults (76.6±6.5 years), with 11.2% prevalence of MCR, 
      dual-task cost was not significantly different, compared to No MCR participants. 
      Among MCR participants, no significant relationship was found between WWT 
      velocity and cognitive function, whereas No MCR participants with better 
      cognitive function showed faster WWT velocities. PFC oxygenation during WWT was 
      higher in MCR compared to No MCR (1.02±1.25 versus 0.66±0.83, p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: MCR participants showed no significant differences in the dual-task 
      cost while exhibiting higher PFC oxygenation during dual-task walking. The 
      dual-task performance (WWT velocity) in MCR participants was not related to 
      cognition.

TI  - The prevalence and associated factors of motoric cognitive risk syndrome in 
      multiple ethnic middle-aged to older adults in west China: a cross-sectional 
      study.
PG  - 1354-1365
LID - 10.1111/ene.15255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome characterized by 
      subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait has been proposed and validated as 
      a pre-dementia syndrome. The overall and specific ethnic prevalence of MCR and 
      the associated factors are poorly understood in middle-aged to older 
      community-dwelling residents in west China. METHODS: The present study included 
      6091 samples from the prospective cohort study, West China Health and Aging Trend 
      (WCHAT). Multidimensional factors of demography, lifestyle, social support, 
      anthropometrics and body components, and clinical status were investigated and 
      analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Lasso 
      regression and K-fold cross-validation were conducted to construct the most 
      predictive model with fitted factors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MCR was 
      9.74%, and ethnically the prevalence was 14.25% in Tibetan, 11.03% in Yi, 10.72% 
      in Han, 5.18% in Uighur and 4.55% in Qiang, respectively. In the adjusted models, 
      the positively associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 1.51, p = 0.007), osteoarthritis (OR = 1.50, p = 0.002), depression 
      (OR = 1.36, p = 0.005), poor sleep (OR = 1.21, p = 0.045), comorbidity 
      (OR = 1.49, p = 0.001) and falls in the last 12 months (OR = 1.34, p = 0.031). Of 
      note, every 1-unit increase of value in stroke was associated with an approximate 
      3-fold higher risk of having MCR, whilst in high-density lipoprotein with a 30% 
      lower risk of MCR,respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Profiles of MCR from the aspects of 
      ethnicity and the presenium stage need further exploration. It is a promising 
      strategy to apply MCR as a primary prevention tool to prevent dementia.

TI  - Vitamin D Concentration and Motoric Cognitive Risk in Older Adults: Results from 
      the Gait and Alzheimer Interactions Tracking (GAIT) Cohort.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192013086 [doi]
LID - 13086
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome, which combines subjective 
      memory complaint (SMC) and slower gait speed, is a newly-described predementia 
      stage. Based on the involvement of vitamin D in the biology of both gait and 
      cognition, we hypothesized that nondemented individuals with MCR would exhibit 
      hypovitaminosis D more often compared to Cognitively Healthy Individuals (CHI). 
      The objective of this cross-sectional analysis was to determine whether 
      hypovitaminosis D was associated with MCR. METHODS: Participants without dementia 
      from the GAIT (Gait and Alzheimer Interactions Tracking) cohort study were 
      classified into MCR or Cognitively Healthy Individuals (CHI) groups. 
      Hypovitaminosis D was defined as the lowest quartile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25OHD) concentration compared to the other three combined. Age, sex, body mass 
      index (BMI), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) score, the Mini-Mental Short 
      Examination (MMSE) score, education level, use of psychoactive drugs, and the 
      number of chronic diseases were used as covariates. RESULTS: Among 244 
      nondemented and nonMCInonMCR participants from the GAIT cohort (mean age 71.4 ± 
      3.7 years, 40.6% women), 66 participants were classified as MCR (36.9%) and 178 
      as CHI (63.1%). The lowest quartile of 25OHD concentration was directly 
      associated with MCR (unadjusted OR = 2.85, p = 0.003) even after adjustment for 
      studied potential confounders (fully adjusted OR = 2.61, p = 0.025). The BMI 
      (adjusted OR = 6.65, p < 0.001), MMSE score (adjusted OR = 0.74, p = 0.009), FAB 
      score (adjusted OR = 0.51, p < 0.001), number of chronic diseases (adjusted OR = 
      1.29, p = 0.043) and use of psychoactive drugs (adjusted OR = 2.55, p = 0.044) 
      were also associated with MCR. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovitaminosis D was associated with 
      MCR in older community-dwellers without dementia.

      combines slow gait speed and subjective cognitive concerns (SCC). The SCC 
      criterion is presently unstandardized, possibly limiting risk detection. We 
      sought to (a) characterize SCC practices through MCR literature review; (b) 
      investigate the ability of SCC in slow gait individuals in predicting the 
      likelihood of cognitive impairment in a demographically diverse sample of 
      community-dwelling, nondemented older adults. METHODS: First, we comprehensively 
      reviewed the MCR literature, extracting information regarding SCC measures, 
      items, sources, and cognitive domain. Next, Einstein Aging Study (EAS) 
      participants (N = 278, Mage = 77.22 ± 4.74, %female = 67, Meducation = 15 ± 3.61, 
      %non-Hispanic White = 46.3) completed gait, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), 
      and SCC assessment at baseline and annual follow-up (Mfollow-up = 3.5). Forty-two 
      participants met slow gait criteria at baseline. Generalized linear mixed-effects 
      models examined baseline SCC to predict cognitive impairment on CDR over 
      follow-up. RESULTS: We reviewed all published MCR studies (N = 106) and 
      documented ambiguity in SCC criteria, with a prevalent approach being use of a 
      single self-reported memory item. In EAS, high SCC endorsement on a 
      comprehensive, validated screen significantly affected the rate of cognitive 
      impairment (CDR; βinteraction = 0.039, p = .018) in slow gait individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An assessment approach that queries across numerous SCC domains was 
      found to predict future decline in clinical dementia status in slow gait older 
      adults. Current SCC practices in MCR, which tend to utilize a single-memory item, 
      may not be the optimal approach. We discuss the implications of SCC criteria 
      validation and standardization to enhance early dementia detection in MCR.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a recently described 
      pre-dementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaints that 
      has been implicated as a predictor of cognitive decline and dementia in older 
      adults. Previous work suggests that cerebrovascular disease is associated with 
      MCR. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are postulated to be a product of 
      cerebrovascular disease, and have been associated with impaired mobility and 
      impaired cognition. This study aimed to determine if MCR is associated with 
      regional WMH. METHODS: Two cross-cultural cohorts of non-demented older adults 
      were examined: 174 from a French memory clinic (62.1% male, mean age 70.7 ± 4.3 
      years) and 184 from an Indian community-dwelling cohort (55.4% male, mean age 
      66.2 ± 5.2 years). Participants were evaluated for slow gait, cognitive 
      complaints, and regional WMH via MRI (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) FLAIR 
      sequence. RESULTS: Overall, 20.7% of participants met criteria for MCR, and 72.9% 
      of participants had WMH on FLAIR. WMH in the frontal, parieto-occipital, 
      temporal, basal ganglia, cerebellum, or brainstem were not associated with MCR in 
      either of the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: WMH was not significantly associated with 
      MCR in this studied sample of participants, suggesting that other cerebrovascular 
      pathophysiological mechanisms, or combination of mechanisms, might underlie MCR.

TI  - Association Between Sleep and Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome Among 
      Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Results From the China Health and Retirement 
      Longitudinal Study.

AB  - Background: Sleep is increasingly recognized as an important lifestyle 
      contributor to health; however, its relationship with Motoric cognitive risk 
      syndrome (MCR) is still unclear. The present study aimed to examine the 
      associations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and MCR among 
      community-dwelling Chinese older adults. Methods: We recruited 5,387 participants 
      aged ≥60 years from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). 
      Sleep-related variables including night sleep duration and sleep quality were 
      assessed via self-reported questionnaires. MCR syndrome was defined as cognitive 
      complaints and slow gait speed without dementia or impaired mobility. 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the 
      associations between sleep-related variables and MCR after controlling for all 
      potential confounders including demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, 
      and comorbidities. Results: We found that sleep duration was significantly 
      associated with MCR, and the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) were highest 
      for those with the shortest (<6 h OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.18-2.04) and longest (≥10 
      h OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.03-2.91) sleep durations. Moreover, an increasing 
      frequency of self-perceived poor sleep quality was significantly associated with 
      MCR in the adjusted model (3-4 days OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.16-2.17; 5-7 days OR = 
      1.81, 95% CI = 1.37-2.40). Conclusions: Our study indicated an inverted U-shaped 
      association between night sleep duration and MCR. Poor sleep quality was also 
      associated with higher odds of MCR in community-dwelling Chinese elders. 
      Longitudinal studies with a larger population size are needed to establish 
      causality in the future and further explore potential action mechanisms.

TI  - The Mediating Role of Social Participation in Motoric Cognitive Risk and its 
      Relation to Depression and Loneliness in Older Adults.
PG  - 134-140
LID - 10.4235/agmr.23.0007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) reduces the quality of life, 
      independence, and social interaction in older adults. Social participation is a 
      potentially modifiable factor that benefits cognitive and mental health. This 
      study explored the mediating roles of social participation between MCR and 
      depression and between MCR and loneliness. METHODS: We performed a secondary 
      analysis of data from the 2015-2016 National Social Life, Health, and Aging 
      Project. Slow gait speed and cognitive decline were used to assess MCR. Mediation 
      analysis was applied to two models, both of which used MCR as an exposure and 
      social participation as a mediator. The outcomes were depression and loneliness 
      for each model, respectively. RESULTS: Among 1,697 older adults, 196 (11.6%) had 
      MCR. The mediating role of social participation was statistically significant in 
      both models. The indirect effect (β=0.267, p=0.001) of MCR on depression through 
      social participation comprised 11.97% of the total effect (β=2.231, p&lt;0.001). 
      The indirect effect (β=0.098, p=0.001) of MCR on loneliness through social 
      participation was 19.48% of the total effect (β=0.503, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Interventions to increase social participation may reduce depression and 
      loneliness of older adults with MCR.

AB  - Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a newly described predementia syndrome 
      characterized by the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait, which is 
      associated with increased risk of conversion to dementia. The underlying 
      biological mechanisms for MCR have not yet been established. Neuroinflammation 
      mediated through cytokines plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of dementia. 
      Hence, our objective was to prospectively examine whether variations in cytokine 
      genes (CRP, IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL18, TNF, and IL12A) play a role 
      in MCR incidence in 530 community-dwelling Ashkenazi Jewish adults aged 65 years 
      and older without MCR or dementia at baseline enrolled in the LonGenity study. 
      Over a median follow-up of 2.99 years, 70 participants developed MCR. Single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transcriptional regulatory regions of 
      cytokine IL10, rs1800896 (hazard ratio adjusted for age, gender, and education, 
      aHR: 1.667; 95% CI: 1.198-2.321) and rs3024498 (aHR: 1.926; 95% CI: 1.315-2.822), 
      were associated with incident MCR. Functional analysis using in silico approaches 
      indicated associated SNP rs3024498 "C" allele being the local expression 
      quantitative trait locus. Associated alleles of both the SNPs, rs1800896 and 
      rs3024498, were implicated with overexpression of IL10 gene. None of the variants 
      in the neuroinflammatory pathway studied were associated with incident mild 
      cognitive impairment syndrome. These observations support a role for the IL10 
      gene in dementia pathogenesis by increasing risk of developing MCR in older 
      adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) is characterized by slow gait 
      and subjective cognitive decline. It is a predementia syndrome associated with an 
      increased risk of dementia and mortality. AIMS: To investigate the incidence of 
      MCRS and its associated factors in older adults in Türkiye. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      retrospective study. METHODS: This study enrolled community-dwelling older adults 
      admitted to the geriatric outpatient clinic. Participants were assessed for MCRS 
      according to previously described criteria. Logistic regression analysis was 
      conducted to evaluate the association among MCRS and demographic features, 
      clinical status, and geriatric syndromes. RESULTS: Of the 1,352 older adults 
      examined, 577 met the inclusion criteria, and the mean age was 75.2 years. The 
      overall incidence of MCRS was 7.8%. The MCRS group was predominantly older, 
      female, and unmarried, with polypharmacy and higher Deyo-Charlson comorbidity 
      index and Yesavage geriatric depression scale scores than the non-MCRS group. In 
      the multivariate model, significant associations were found between MCRS and age 
      and polypharmacy [odds ratios (OR), 2.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      1.04-4.71, p = 0.039; OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02-3.99, p = 0.043, respectively]. 
      CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of MCRS was found in 7.8% of older adults. 
      Advanced age and polypharmacy are risk factors associated with MCRS.

      in motoric cognitive risk syndrome: A pilot study using plasma Aβ42 and total 
      tau.
PG  - 981632

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a conceptual construct that 
      combines slow gait speed with subjective cognitive complaints and has been shown 
      to be associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. However, the 
      relationships between the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MCR syndrome 
      remain uncertain. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the 
      levels of plasma AD biomarkers (Aβ42 and total tau) and their relationships with 
      cognition in individuals with MCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional pilot study that enrolled 25 individuals with normal cognition 
      (NC), 27 with MCR, and 16 with AD. Plasma Aβ42 and total tau (t-tau) levels were 
      measured using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays. A comprehensive 
      neuropsychological assessment was also performed. RESULTS: The levels of plasma 
      t-tau proteins did not differ significantly between the MCR and AD groups, but 
      that of plasma t-tau was significantly increased in the MCR and AD groups, 
      compared to the NC group. Visuospatial performance was significantly lower in the 
      MCR group than in the NC group. The levels of plasma t-tau correlated 
      significantly with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Boston naming 
      test scores in the MCR group. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, we found 
      significantly increased plasma t-tau proteins in the MCR and AD groups, compared 
      with the NC group. The plasma t-tau levels were also significantly correlated 
      with the cognitive function of older adults with MCR. These results implied that 
      MCR and AD may share similar pathology. However, these findings need further 
      confirmation in longitudinal studies.

      Study.
PG  - 1090-1095
LID - 10.1007/s12603-021-1678-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a newly described 
      pre-dementia syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait and is 
      associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Previous studies have indicated an 
      association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and cognitive decline, but no clear 
      relationship between CRP and MCR has been reported. The purpose of the study is 
      to examine the associations between CRP with MCR and MCR subtypes. METHODS: 
      Participants were 5,642 adults aged ≥60 years from the China Health and 
      Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). MCR was defined as cognitive complaints 
      and slow gait speed without dementia or impaired mobility. Two subtypes of MCR 
      were defined by whether memory impairment (MI) was also present, such as MCR-MI 
      and MCR-non-MI. MI was evaluated through the immediate recall and delayed recall 
      in a word recall test during the CHARLS and was defined as 1.0 standard deviation 
      or more below the mean values of the test scores in this cohort. RESULTS: Of the 
      participants, 421 (7.46%) met the criteria for MCR. After multivariate 
      adjustment, participants with higher CRP levels had an increased likelihood of 
      MCR (fourth quartile: adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.44; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.06-1.95) compared with those in the first quartile group. The OR for 
      MCR-MI was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.35-3.09) for the highest quartile of CRP compared to 
      the lowest quartile. No significant associations between CRP levels and odds of 
      MCR-non-MI were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher CRP levels were associated with 
      increased odds of prevalent MCR-MI but not MCR-non-MI among community-dwelling 
      older adults.

PG  - 1047-1054
LID - 10.1111/ene.13331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a pre-dementia 
      syndrome. There is little information on the cognitive profile of individuals 
      with MCR syndrome and its overlap with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndrome. 
      This study aimed to examine and compare the cognitive performance of non-demented 
      older community dwellers with and without MCR and MCI syndromes. METHODS: A total 
      of 291 non-demented individuals were selected from the Gait and Alzheimer 
      Interactions Tracking study, which is a cross-sectional study. All participants 
      were referred to a memory clinic. Individuals with and without MCR were separated 
      into those with and without MCI. Cognitive performance was measured using the 
      scores of the Mini Mental Status Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, Free 
      and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Trail Making Test part A and B, and Stroop 
      test. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 40.1% and that of MCR was 18.2%, with a 
      higher prevalence of MCI in MCR group compared with the non-MCR group (47.2% vs. 
      39.5%). Individuals with MCR and MCI syndromes had poorer cognitive performance 
      in all domains compared with those without MCR (P < 0.005), except for the ratio 
      part III: part I of the Stroop test (P = 0.345). The association between 
      cognitive performance and MCR syndrome was worse on the Mini Mental Status 
      Examination score [effect size, -0.57 (95% confidence interval, -1.02 to -0.12)] 
      and Trail Making Test part B [effect size, 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 
      0.14-1.04)] in individuals with MCR and MCI syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome is associated with low global cognitive performance. 
      Association of MCR and MCI syndromes is characterized by a worse cognitive 
      performance.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-150523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of cerebral small vessel disease to cognitive 
      decline, especially in non-Caucasian populations, is not well established. 
      OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between cerebral small vessel disease and 
      motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a recently described pre-dementia 
      syndrome, in Indian seniors. METHODS: 139 participants (mean age 66.6 ± 5.4 y, 
      33.1% female) participating in the Kerala-Einstein study in Southern India were 
      examined in a cross-sectional study. The presence of cerebral small vessel 
      disease (lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds (CMB)) and white matter 
      hyperintensities on MRI was ascertained by raters blinded to clinical 
      information. MCR was defined by the presence of cognitive complaints and slow 
      gait in older adults without dementia or mobility disability. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-eight (27.3%) participants met MCR criteria. The overall prevalence of 
      lacunar infarcts and CMB was 49.6% and 9.4% , respectively. Lacunar infarcts in 
      the frontal lobe, but no other brain regions, were associated with MCR even after 
      adjusting for vascular risk factors and presence of white matter hyperintensities 
      (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 4.67, 95% CI: 1.69-12.94). Frontal lacunar infarcts 
      were associated with slow gait (aOR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.46-10.79) and poor 
      performance on memory test (β: -1.24, 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.05), but not with 
      cognitive complaints or non-memory tests. No association of CMB was found with 
      MCR, individual MCR criterion or cognitive tests. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal lacunar 
      infarcts are associated with MCR in Indian seniors, perhaps, by contributing to 
      slow gait and poor memory function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding falls risk in advanced age is critical with people over 
      80 a rapidly growing demographic. Slow gait and cognitive complaint are 
      established risk factors and together comprise the Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome (MCR). This study examined trajectories of gait and cognition and their 
      association with falls over 5 years, and documented MCR in Māori and non-Māori of 
      advanced age living in New Zealand. METHOD: Falls frequency was ascertained 
      retrospectively at annual assessments. 3 m gait speed was measured and cognition 
      was assessed using the Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (3MS). Frequency 
      of MCR was reported. Gait and cognition trajectories were modelled and clusters 
      identified from Latent Class Analysis. Generalised linear models examined 
      association between changes in gait, cognition, MCR and falls. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 138 of 408 Māori (34%) and 205 of 512 non-Māori (40%) had fallen. Mean 
      (SD) gait speed (m/s) for Māori was 0.66 (0.29) and 0.82 (0.26) for non-Māori. 
      Respective 3MS scores were 86.2 (15.6) and 91.6 (10.4). Ten (4.3%) Maori 
      participants met MCR criteria, compared with 7 (1.9%) non-Māori participants. 
      Māori men were more likely to fall (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.0-2.43 (P = 0.04) whilst 
      for non-Māori slow gait increased falls risk (OR 0.40; 95% CI 
      0.24-0.68(P < 0.001). Non-Māori with MCR were more than twice as likely to fall 
      than those without MCR (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.06-5.68 (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Māori 
      and non-Māori of advanced age show a mostly stable pattern of gait and cognition 
      over time. Risk factors for falls differ for Māori, and do not include gait and 
      cognition.

TI  - Neuroepidemiologic and Neurobehavioral Characteristics of Motoric Cognitive Risk 
      Syndrome in an Old-Old Population: The Kurihara Project.
PG  - 176-82
LID - 10.1159/000445539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the concept of motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome was 
      proposed, where slow gait is considered a risk factor for conversion to dementia. 
      AIM: To retrospectively investigate the characteristics of MCR among a population 
      aged 75+ years, focusing on the aspects of epidemiology and neurobehavioral 
      characteristics. METHOD: The participants were 590 residents aged 75+ years 
      living in Kurihara who underwent MRI and neurobehavioral assessments including 
      walking velocity. The prevalence of MCR and conversion to dementia (AD8 Dementia 
      Screening Interview cutoff 2/8), together with the neurobehavioral 
      characteristics of the MCR group, were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence was 
      11.1%, and the conversion ratio in the MCR group was higher than that in the 
      non-MCR group (OR = 1.38). The MCR group had lower scores on the executive 
      function test as well as gait velocity. CONCLUSIONS: The MCR syndrome increases 
      the rate of conversion to dementia, and both slow gait and lower scores in 
      executive tests, which are 'frontal-based' functions, are predictive of higher 
      rates of conversion to dementia.

TI  - A Gray Matter Volume Covariance Network Associated with the Motoric Cognitive 
      Risk Syndrome: A Multicohort MRI Study.
PG  - 884-889
LID - 10.1093/gerona/gly158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome is a predementia syndrome 
      characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaint that predicts both Alzheimer's 
      disease and vascular dementia. Yet, we know very little about the brain 
      structures and brain pathologies associated with MCR. The aim of this study was 
      to identify gray matter (GM) networks associated with MCR. METHODS: We used 
      voxel-based morphometry and multivariate covariance-based statistics to identify 
      GM networks associated with MCR in a pooled sample of 267 older adults without 
      dementia from three different cohorts-two North American cohorts and one French 
      cohort. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 75.63 years, 50.56% identified 
      as female, 57.68% had ≥13 years of education, and 5.99% had a prior history of 
      stroke. A total of 14.23% participants met criteria for MCR. We identified a 
      significant GM volume covariance pattern that was associated with MCR-even after 
      adjusting for age, sex, education, mild cognitive impairment, stroke, total 
      intracranial volume, and cohort status. This GM volume covariance network was 
      primarily composed of supplementary motor, insular, and prefrontal cortex 
      regions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MCR is primarily associated 
      with GM atrophy in brain regions previously linked to the control aspects of gait 
      such as motor planning and modulation rather than the motor aspects of gait such 
      as gait initiation and maintenance.

TI  - Association between perceived stress and motoric cognitive risk syndrome in an 
      elderly population: Rugao longevity and ageing study.
LID - 10.1159/000537937 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Previous studies have indicated a correlation between perceived 
      stress and cognitive decline. However, it remains unknown whether high levels of 
      perceived stress can result in motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome. This study 
      investigated the relationship between perceived stress and MCR in a 
      community-based population. Methods The study cohort comprised 852 elderly 
      individuals from the Rugao Longitudinal Aging Cohort. Perceived stress was 
      assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), while MCR was defined 
      as the coexistence of subjective memory complaints (SMCs) and slow gait speed. 
      Results The average age of the study participants is 79.84 ± 4.34 years. The mean 
      score of PSS-10 among participants is 10.32 (range = 0-33; [SD] = 5.71), with a 
      median score of 10.00 (6.00, 14.00). The prevalence of MCR is 9.3%. In the 
      logistic regression analysis, for each 1-SD (5.71) increase in the global PSS-10 
      score, the risk of MCR increased by 40% (95% CI 1.09-1.80). Additionally, in the 
      aspect of two components of MCR, with a 1-SD increase (5.71) in the global PSS-10 
      score, there was a 50% (95% CI 1.29-1.75) increase in the risk of SMCs and a 27% 
      (95% CI 1.04-1.55) increase in the risk of slow gait speed. In terms of specific 
      walking speed, there was a reverse correlation between the global PSS-10 score 
      and walking speed (r = -0.14, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study provided 
      preliminary evidence that high levels of perceived stress were associated with 
      the risk of MCR in a community-dwelling population.

      longitudinal study on aging.
PG  - 409-418

AB  - Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), anxio-depressive disorders (ADD), and 
      depression are associated with cognitive complaint and slow gait speed. The study 
      aims to examine (1) the association of ADD and depression with MCR, and (2) the 
      influence of the type and the severity of ADD and age on this association in 
      older adults. A total of 29,569 participants free from cognitive impairment with 
      walking speed measure recruited at baseline in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on 
      Aging (CLSA) Comprehensive were selected in this cross-sectional study. They were 
      separated into different sub-groups based on their age groups (i.e., 45-54, 
      55-64, 65-74, and ≥ 75) and the presence of MCR. Anxiety, mood, and depressive 
      disorders (ADD) were assessed. Depression was defined by the Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score ≥ 10. The overall 
      prevalence of MCR was 7.0 % and was greater in the youngest age group (8.9 %) as 
      compared to the other age groups (P < 0.05). There was a higher prevalence of ADD 
      and depression in individuals with MCR compared to those without MCR for all age 
      groups (P ≤ 0.001). Depression was significantly associated with MCR regardless 
      of age group (odds ratio ≥ 3.65 with P ≤ 0.001). The association of ADD with MCR 
      depended on the accumulation of disorders and not their type, and was weaker and 
      more inconstant in the oldest age group as compared to younger age groups. MCR is 
      associated with ADD and depression in both younger and older individuals. This 
      association is stronger for depression in younger individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify heterogeneous developmental trajectories of handgrip 
      strength (HGS) in Chinese older adults and to explore the relationship between 
      different developmental trajectories and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR). 
      METHODS: We used three waves of longitudinal data from the China Health and 
      Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2015, which involved 3773 older 
      adults. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to estimate trajectory classes for 
      HGS, followed by binary logistic regression to explore the association between 
      trajectory classes and MCR. RESULTS: GMM analyses extracted four distinct 
      trajectories of HGS: low level-declining group (16.0 %), upper middle level group 
      (30.9 %), high level-steady group (9.5 %), and lower middle level group (43.6 %). 
      In addition, we found that even after adjusting for important covariates, the 
      odds of MCR prevalence were lower in the medium level-high group, high 
      level-steady group, and medium level-low group compared with the low 
      level-declining group. CONCLUSION: Appreciable heterogeneity in HGS among older 
      people in China was revealed. Only 9.5 % of older people with HGS in the high 
      level-steady group. And poorer grip strength levels mean a higher risk of MCR. 
      Therefore, interventions should be taken to maintain muscle mass and thus prevent 
      MCR in older adults.

TI  - Associations of visual, hearing, and dual sensory impairment with motoric 
      cognitive risk syndrome: Observational and Mendelian randomization analyses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is associated with individual vision impairment (VI) and 
      hearing impairment (HI). However, little is known about their associations with 
      motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia stage. We investigated the 
      association of VI, HI, and dual sensory impairment (DSI) with MCR and to further 
      evaluate causal relationships using Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. 
      METHODS: First, an observational study was conducted in the China Health and 
      Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Evaluate the cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal associations of VI, HI, and DSI with MCR using the logistic 
      regression models and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Second, 
      evaluate the causal association between VI and HI with MCR using MR analysis. The 
      GWAS data was used for genetic instruments, including 88,250 of European ancestry 
      (43,877 cases and 44,373 controls) and 504,307 with "white British" ancestry 
      (100,234 cases and 404,073 controls), respectively; MCR information was obtained 
      from the GWAS with 22,593 individuals. Inverse variance weighted was the primary 
      method and sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the robustness of MR 
      methods. RESULTS: In the observational study, VI (HR: 1.767, 95%CI: 1.331-2.346; 
      p < 0.001), HI (HR: 1.461, 95%CI: 1.196-1.783; p < 0.001), and DSI (HR: 1.507, 
      95%CI: 1.245-1.823; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk 
      of MCR. For the MR, no causal relationship between VI (OR: 0.902, 95% CI: 
      0.593-1.372; p = 0.631) and HI (OR: 1.016, 95% CI: 0.989-1.043; p = 0.248) with 
      MCR risk, which is consistent with the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: VI, HI, 
      and DSI were significantly associated with MCR, but MR analysis failed to provide 
      evidence of their causal relationship. Emphasized the importance of sensory 
      impairment screening in identifying high-risk populations for dementia.
